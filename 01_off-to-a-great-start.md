## Chapter 1: Off to a great start

Kaia would have given anything to be normal. Filled with dread and paralyzed by
anxiety, she wished she could be carefree and unconcerned like the other
students in the cacophonous gymnasium.

There was no way out. The polyethylene bleachers where Kaia sat were packed
with the entire cohort of high school freshman. All around the bleachers,
robotic animals buzzed, growled, and roared, while observing the
students.

Kaia leaned in to her best friend Lita and whispered in her ear.

"Let's run."

"We wouldn't even make it to the door, which is locked by the way."

"If we run, they'll have to knock us out and we'll miss the ceremony."

Kaia and Lita looked at the hexagonal holes in the walls. Inside the walls,
there was a network of tunnels filled with robotic insects always ready to
swarm anyone who stepped out of line.

"If the buzzBees knocked us out, the wakeupWasps would sting us until we were
awake."

"Maybe if we act crazy, they'd knock us out to keep us from disrupting the
ceremony."

"Acting crazy should be easy for you, because you've always been insane."

Lita could see that the joke didn't land well, so she tried to reassure her
friend.

"Maybe it won't be so bad. Maybe I won't have a seizure and you won't freak
out."

"Awww, you always know exactly what to say to keep me from freaking out."

Lita smiled and put her arm around Kaia pretending to put her into a headlock.
Before she realized it, Kaia's head was resting on Lita's shoulder as the two
embraced. Several students in their vicinity started to jeer.

"Get a room, you two!"

"Looks like the sexual tension was too much for them!"

"Which one is butch? And what do you call the other one?"

Kaia wondered if she was imagining the jeers until she felt Lita tense up and
eventually withdraw from their embrace. For as long as she could remember, Kaia
had auditory hallucinations. She always had trouble differentiating between the
voices of people around her and the voices in her head.

To make matters worse, Kaia often had strange dreams at night and weird visions
during the day. The dreams and visions seemed so real and familiar that it
sometimes took Kaia a long time to reacclimatize to reality.

The jeering continued until the school principal walked up to the podium in
front of the bleachers. Suddenly the gymnasium fell quiet. Even the robotic
animals were silent as the principal cleared his throat and
prepared to speak.

Already sweating, the principal his brow with a lace handkerchief he retrieved
the pocket of his blazer. With three clicks of his tongue, the principal
summoned three robotic bees. The buzzBees landed on the principal's face and
neck and used their stingers to administer the pharmacological relief that the
principal would need to collect his frayed nerves.

"Today we welcome a new cohort of-"

As the principal began to speak, a student with bright purple hair jumped on
top of her seat in the bleachers and began to shout into a hand-held gigaphone.

"Corporeal punishment is barbaric and ineffective!"

"taserTutors are torture!"

"Reform the school system!"

A chaseChimpanzee jumped down from the rafters and tackled the student,
knocking the gigaphone out of her hand. Several guardGorillas
scooped up the student and carried her out of the gymnasium.

Visibly shaken, the principal repeated his pre-speech ritual by clearing his
throat again and clicking his tongue three more times. The three additional
robotic bee stings were successful in calming down the principal, but when the
principal resumed his speech, he was swaying side to side, gripping the podium
for support, and having difficulty speaking clearly.

"Dishipline and rispet for aufority are eshenshial for a funshioning shosh-"

The principal suddenly lurched forward and vomited all over the podium.

Wiping his mouth with the sleeve of his blazer, the principal wrapped up his
speech.

"Let the sheremony begin!"

As soon as an automated voice started calling students to participate in the
initiation ceremony, the gymnasium erupted with the excited chatter of the
students and the sounds of the robotic wildlife.

Kaia leaned in to whisper to Lita again, but stopped when she noticed that her
friend was having a seizure. Lita's expressionless face moved ever so slightly
as she blankly stared into the distance.

When she realized that the seizure was relatively mild and that Lita would
recover shortly, Kaia let out a sigh of relief. While waiting for her friend to
recover, Kaia held Lita's hands, which unfortunately attracted the attention of
nearby students.

"I think she's about to propose!"

"Is that even legal?"

"Someone get the securitySimians to arrest those two!"

After seeing it countless times, Kaia knew exactly what to expect. As the
seizure ended, Lita looked around disoriented and confused. The part that
always broke Kaia's heart was when Lita looked embarrassed about having a
seizure. Lita pulled her hands away.

Never knowing what to say, Kaia tried to start a conversation.

"What do you think will happen to the protester?"

"She's going to get kicked out of school."

"How do you know?"

"She didn't go through the ceremony."

"Maybe we can protest too?"

Clearly not in the mood to continue the conversation, Lita did not reply.
The two friends sat in silence until Kaia's name was called.

Desperate for a means of escape, Kaia looked pleadingly at Lita. Trying her
best to be reassuring, Lita smiled weakly and gave Kaia a gesture of
encouragement. Left with no other option, Kaia got up and started to squeeze
through the rows of students.

Kaia could feel the eyes of the students and robotic animals follow her to the
taserTutor next to the podium in front of the bleachers. The taserTutor looked
a table covered with a silvery hair. As she approached, the taserTutor began to
writhe as it adjusted to match her height and build. Robotic birds, bats, and
bugs flew in circles above Kaia. A wall of historianHummingbirds hovered in
front of her face, recording her every move from multiple angles , staring at
her with their piercing eyes, relaying everything they saw to the projector
system that displayed a multitude of video feeds on the hexagonal walls of the
gymnasium.

When Kaia placed her palms down on the taserTutor, metallic tendrils extended from
the taserTutor and wrapped around her arms up to the shoulders like vines around a
tree. The automated voice that had called Kaia's name earlier began to deliver
commands.

"State your full name."

"Kaialeiala Erkadia."

"State your age in years."

"14."

"List the three branches of Government."

"The CorporateCouncil, the DemocraticDelegation, and the EternalEnlightened."

So far so good, but the next questions would be much more difficult.

"Given an average distance of 382 megameters, calculate the time in seconds
required for a radio transmission to go from the surface of Earth to its moon
and back."

Kaia typed out the problem in the virtual keyboard on the taserTutor.
Distance: 382 megameters.
Speed of light: 300 megameters per second.
Time: 382 / 300 seconds = 1.27 seconds

Kaia opened her mouth to answer, but froze in horror.
"And back!", she said to herself.
"From Earth to the moon AND BACK!"

Terrified at the thought that she almost answered incorrectly, Kaia did the
final calculation in her head.

"2.54 seconds!"

Kaia braced for an electric shock, but was relieved to hear the next question
instead.

"Given a distance range of 590 to 980 gigameters, calculate the minimum time in
minutes required for a radio transmission to go from the surface of Earth to
Jupiter."

Kaia's head was spinning.

"No 'and back' this time.", she said to herself. "Minimum means 590
gigameters."

Distance: 590 gigameters
Speed of light: 18 gigameters per minute
Time: 590 / 18 seconds ...

"32.78 minutes."

The pressure was getting to Kaia. She loved math, but hated solving word
problems under threat of electric shock while everyone was watching. Luckily,
the next question tested general knowledge.

"Which mineral group is the most abundant in Earth's crust and what are it's
three endmembers?

"The feldspars are the most abundant. The endmembers are potassium feldspar,
albite, and anorthite."

"Construct the basic subunit of the feldspar chemical structure."

The display on the taserTutor transformed from a keyboard into the periodic
chart of elements. On top of each square on the chart was a sphere that
represented an element. Kaia used the display to enter the number of atoms of
each she would need. Each time she entered a number, a new set of spheres
appeared in front of her. In total, Kaia had 4 potassium atoms, 4 aluminum
atoms, 12 silicon atoms, and 128 oxygen atoms. Kaia began arranging the
spheres. The metallic tendrils extending from the taserTutor stretched as she
moved her hands from sphere to sphere. First, Kaia created 16 tiny pyramids by
sticking 4 oxygen atoms to each aluminum and silicon atom. Then, she combined
the pyramids into 4 rings by removing an oxygen from each pyramid and replacing
it with the oxygen of another pyramid. Next, Kaia removed an oxygen to from
each ring to arrange the rings in pairs. After removing an oxygen from each
pair, Kaia stacked the pairs on top of each other. Finally, Kaia put two
potassium atoms in the middle of the structure and then the last two potassium
atoms on opposites corners of the structure.

"This is the chemical structure of the basic subunit of potassium feldspar."

Kaia's arms felt like they were made of feldspar. She was so exhausted that she
almost did not care if she answered correctly or not.

"Describe the mineral composition of the Martian crust.

"The crust of Mars includes volcanic rock minerals such as feldspars,
pyroxenes, and olivine."

"Explain the origin of nanostructures on the surface of Mars.

"The nanostructures originate from the two sources: the ancient Martian
civilization-"

Kaia stopped mid-sentence. She felt like her mouth was filled with Martian
dust. A pulsing red light warned Kaia that pauses were not allowed.

"-and Thelusian spacecrafts that collided with Mars during the
Martian-Thelusian War."

Kaia looked up. The sky, once dark with orbiting spacecrafts, lit up as the
entire Thelusian armada began to enter the thin Martian atmosphere.

"Compare and contrast the EternalEnlightened with the other branches of
government.

People all around Kaia began to run for cover, but she knew there was nowhere
to hide. Everyone was running and screaming except for her and Lita.

"What is Lita doing here on Mars?", Kaia wondered.

With an alarmed and desperate look on her face, Lita pointed down in front of
Kaia. Unsure why Lita was pointing down and not up at impending cataclysm in
the sky, Kaia looked down at the pulsing red light emanating from the metallic
table. Kaia's body shook with electricity. Time had run out. Mars was doomed.

"Given that the Venusian orbital period is 225 days, calculate how many days
would pass before Earth and Venus would return to their current positions.

Kaia was having trouble maintain her footing. Beneath her feet, countless
skeletons were crumbling into dust. The dust began to swirl in circles around
Kaia, as a ferocious wind built up into a raging storm. In the eye of the
storm, Kaia stood staring at the remnants of an extinguished world. When
lightning shot out of storm and struck Kaia, she screamed, not in pain, but in
anger.

With the loss of an entire civilization weighing down on her, Kaia fell to her
knees. The storm eventually began to subside and through the dust and skeletal
fragments Kaia could see the pulsing red warning light of the taserTutor. The
tendrils were still wrapped around her arms. The initiation ceremony was still
ongoing.

Another shock from the tendrils caused Kaia to spasm and she hit her head on
the taserTutor. Enraged, Kaia stood up to look at the console atop the
taserTutor. There was no way to stop the ceremony once it had begun and
breaking free from the tendrils was impossible. The automated voice continued
providing instructions, but Kaia was no longer paying attention. The ceremony
seemed so insignificant when compared to the destruction of Mars. Kaia just
wanted it to end. As the taserTutor once again begun to pulse red, Kaia used
the virtual keyboard to skip the current task.

The resulting electric shock only added to the fury that Kaia felt. As soon as
she could control her fingers again, Kaia began skipping task after task,
racing through each subsequent electric shock. Her ears were ringing. Tears
were streaming down her face. Her breathing was hoarse and uneven. The burning
smell was suffocating. Her mouth tasted like it was coated with metal. Rage was
the only thing keeping her going.

Kaia kept trying to skip even after the console stopped responding and the
tendrils began to unwrap from around her arms. Bracing against the taserTutor
for support and still focused on the console, Kaia was an easy target for the
did not even notice the chaseChimpanzees charging towards her. The
chaseChimpanzees tackled Kaia into taserTutor so hard that she bounced off and
ended sprawled on the floor. A guardGorilla lumbered up to Kaia, grabbed her by
an ankle, and proceeded to drag her out of the gymnasium.

As she was dragged past the bleachers, Kaia looked searched for Lita in the sea
of standing and staring students. The automated voice was already calling the
next student up to the taserTutor. Lita pushed through the densely packed crowd
of students, leapt off the bleachers, and ran towards Kaia. When she was a
steps away from Kaia, a nearby guardGorilla grabbed Lita by her shirt and
plucked her off the ground. Simultaneously kicking and punching the
guardGorilla, Lita fought to break free. Reaching her hand out to Lita, Kaia
tried to say her name, but the sound that came was nothing more than a pitiful
moan.

Suspended in the air, Lita braced her legs against the guardGorilla that was
carrying her and pushed off like a olympic swimmer completing a flip turn.
Lita's shirt ripped and she landed shirtless flat on the ground. Crawling on
her hands and knees, Lita made it Kaia and grabbed her outstretched hand.
Seemingly perplexed by the situation, the securitySimians paused for a moment.

Still holding the ripped remains of Lita's shirt, one of the guardGorillas
tried to separate the two friends by grabbing Lita's foot. As the guardGorillas
yank from both ends trying to pull them apart, Lita held on to Kaia's hands
with all her strength. When Lita's shoe came off, they hit the ground, Kaia on
her back, Lita on her belly, but they remained linked. The guardGorilla holding
Kaia's ankle seemed to grow impatient and began to drag the two friends out of
the gymnasium.

"At least now, I won't have to go through the ceremony.", Lita joked.

Despite the pain, Kaia smiled. Lita was so brave and strong, always looking out
for Kaia and trying to cheer her up. Kaia's eyes began to well up. Seeing that
her friend was beginning to cry, Lita tried to strike a jovial tone.

"Was this best plan you could come up with?"

"It's better than the one with the buzzBees and wakeupWasps."

"Yeah, I hate bugs."

Lita laughed at her own joke and Kaia's heart melted. Even being dragged
shirtless through a school they would likely soon be expelled from, Lita was
defiant and beautiful. Wishing she could pull Lita closer, Kaia became
overwhelmed with emotion and broke down crying.

"Cheer up, at least we're helping to clean to the floor. Maybe we found our
calling? I can be a broom and you can be a mop!"

When Kaia continued to cry, Lita decided to double down.

"Okay, okay, you can be the broom and I'll be the mop. Is that better?"

Kaia huffed, pretending to be exasperated.

"Admit it. I'm funny! This is the standup comedy show that will redefine the
word standup. Pretty soon every comedian will do shows while being dragged
through the venue."

Kaia rolled her eyes.

"Did you hear the one about the guardGorilla, the historianHummingbird, and
buzzBee?"

"A chaseChimpanzee, a surveillanceSloth, and a messengerMeerkat walk into a
bar...", Kaia retorted.

"There you go! Maybe we can form a comedy duo? We'll get dragged through all
the best places in town!"

When they arrived at the Principal's office, the guardGorilla let go of Kaia's
foot and opened the door. Lita helped Kaia to her feet, put Kaia's arm around
her shoulder, and walked with her towards the office. Leaning against her
friend, Kaia became overwhelmed by the intoxicating scent of Lita's hair and
almost fell over. As they entered the office, they saw the girl with the purple
hair sitting in a chair with a guardGorilla standing behind her.

In the opposite side of the room was a large, well-polished mahogany desk, and behind it sat the
school Principal, snoring loudly with his head tilted back, his mouth open, his
face and neck covered in buzzBees, and drool flowing down the side of his chin.

When she saw the look on the purple-haired girl's bruised face, Kaia began to
wonder what she and Lita looked like. Lita, shirtless and missing a shoe, was
supporting Kaia whose hair was still standing on end from being electrocuted
countless times. The guardGorilla pulled up a pair of chairs for Kaia and Lita.
As soon as she helped Kaia sit down in the chair closest to door, Lita crossed
her arms in front of her exposed chest and sat down in the chair in between
Kaia and the purple-haired girl. Turning towards the purple-haired girl, Lita
tried to start a conversation.

"I think what you did in the gym was awesome!"

"What the hell happened to you?"

"Kaia was doing really well in the ceremony, but then decided to skip the rest
of the taserTutor tasks. She got fried, then the securitySimians got her. I
tried to rescue her, but they got me too and brought us both here."

When the purple-haired girl did not respond, Lita continued.

"My name is Lita. My friend is Kaia. What's your name?"

"Dela."

"Hi Dela! I'd shake your hand, but my hands are full."

Lita looked down at her arms, still crossed in front of her chest. "Very full!"
she exclaimed as she wiggled her shoulders and smiled at Dela.

"Can one of you give me a hand?", Lita said looking back and forth between Dela
and Kaia.

Is she always like this?, Dela asked looking at Kaia.

"Not really. I think she is just happy she got to skip the ceremony."

"Kaia got herself fried so I wouldn't have to go through it."

Dela shook her head.

"There are easier ways to skip the ceremony. You should have protested like
me."

"How did you smuggle in that thing that made your voice really loud?", Lita asked.

"The gigaphone? I didn't smuggle it in. I built it inside the gym from pieces
of broken robotic animals."

"Where did you get the tools from?"

"I built the tools I needed from pieces of broken robotic animals."

Pre-empting the next question, Dela responded before Lita could ask.

"Don't ask me where I got the tools to build the tools I needed to build the
gigaphone."

"Can you teach me to build things?", Lita asked.

"I'd only teach you if you were part of the revolution."

"The revolution?"

"The revolution is a movement that will overthrow the government and build a
better world."

"How are we going to do that?"

"Anyway we can! The system of oppression that forces us to-"

As if on cue, the Principal woke up noisily, send buzzBees flying in every
direction. Disoriented and disconcerted, he looked back and forth between the
three girls in his office. Unsure of what to do, the Principal began to tap at
the console on his desk and mumble to himself. Whenever he looked up, it was
always at Lita's chest. His gaze made her so uncomfortable, Lita shrunk back
into her chair and curled up in a ball, bringing her knees up to her chin and
wrapping her arms around her shins.

"Don't put your shoes on my office furniture!", the Principal barked angrily.

"What happened to your other shoe? And what happened to your shirt?", he asked
disapprovingly.

Kaia watched helplessly as Lita slipped into a seizure. Luckily, Lita stayed in
fetal position in the chair even though her hands floated to her sides.

"Nevermind, I'm pulling up the recordings.", he said, losing patience quickly.

Images of the ceremony showed up on the walls of the Principal's office. Kaia
shivered when she saw herself being repeatedly electrocuted. The visions that
were so powerful during the ceremony now seemed so distant and foreign. She saw
that Lita tried to go to Kaia after the first few electric shocks, but a
chaseChimpanzee pulled her back to her seat on the bleachers.

Everyone in the room winced when they saw Kaia get tackled by a chaseChimpanzee
into the taserTutor. The Principal seemed to be enjoying the show. When Lita's
shirt was ripped off, he bounced in his chair with glee. After the recording
ended, he cleared his throat and put on a serious face.

"The crimes you have committed are very serious. Disruption of the peace,
unsanctioned protest, destruction of school property, indecent exposure,
resisting arrest, assault with a deadly weapon-"

"What weapon?!", Lita exclaimed incredulously.

"The gigaphone is classified as a lethal weapon. And rightly so, it can produce
sounds 1000 times louder than a regular megaphone. If it had been a teraphone,
I could have called in a strike team and had you executed on the spot!"

The Principal's eyes returned to the screen on his desk.

"The EternalEnlightened have reviewed the video evidence related to your case.
The results of your trial should be available any-"

"Possible mitigating circumstances?!", the Principal exclaimed, interrupting himself.

The Principal turned to Kaia.

"The EternalEnlightened have asked for more information about your interaction
with the taserTutor. Why did you only provide responses for some of the tasks?
Were you suffering from a psychotic episode? Or were you making a statement
against corporeal punishment in the school system?"

Surprised to suddenly become the center of attention, Kaia felt her cheeks become flushed
with embarrassment. She understood the reasoning behind the question. The
school had access to all of her medical records, including her diagnoses. Kaia
looked back and forth between Lita and Dela. She wanted to be defiant and
strong like they were. She did not want mental illness to be the reason she got
into the mess. She wanted to be normal.

"It was a protest.", Kaia lied. Lita gasped. Dela nodded approvingly.

"Was the protest premeditated? Did you conspired with the other two girls to
stage the protest?", the Principal read off the screen.

"Yes, I planned the whole thing, but on my own. Lita had nothing to do with it!
She's innocent!", Kaia said.

"She is hardly innocent. Indecent exposure, interruption of a
government-mandated ceremony, and interference with the arrest of a protester
are serious crimes.", the Principal huffed.

"Lita didn't plan for any of that to happen. She was just trying to help me."

"Is this true that you had no idea about the protest plans and were not trying
to make a political statement?", the Principal asked, turning towards Lita.

Still using her legs to shield herself from the prying eyes of the
Principal, Lita nodded, her chin bouncing against her knees.

Turning to Dela, "Did you conspire with the other girls to stage a protest?",
the Principal asked.

"I never even met them until you brought them in here!", Dela exclaimed.

"We have results!", the Principal shouted and read the verdicts and sentences
one after another.

"Ferdinandela Fridzia, you are found guilty of all charges and are sentenced to
four years in juvenile detention."


"Kaiakeilaila Arkadia, you are found guilty of all charges and are sentenced to
three years in juvenile detention."

"Satalitastra Azimuta, you are found guilty of all charges and are sentenced to
one year in juvenile detention."

"Well, our high school careers are really off to a great start.", Lita said
somberly.

"Your sentences can be suspended and you can be allowed to begin your high
school studies if you agree to complete the initiation ceremony, perform
community service, and sign a statement disavowing all previous political
statements and activities. You each can each agree or disagree to the sentence
suspension terms. You must decide before leaving this office."

"We should all agree.", Kaia said quickly, looking at the other two girls.

"I'm not going to agree to anything.", Dela replied dourly.

"If you go to prison, we'll never see you again! If you stay, maybe we can be
friends?"

"I don't want friends, I want to smash the system!"

"You can't start a revolution from inside prison.", Lita said.

"I don't care. I stand by what I did and said."

While Lita kept trying to convince Dela, Kaia looked at the Principal, who had
zoned out and tapping listlessly on his desk console.

"He wants you to refuse, so he can send you to prison and not have
to deal with you! Are you just going to give him what he wants?"

When Dela did not answer, Kaia got the Principal's attention.

"Principal Naksos, what do you think we should do?"

The Principal looked up from the console and looked confused.

"What decision do you think we should make? Should we accept or refuse?"

"I would encourage you to not compromise your deeply held beliefs. It is very
likely you would all end up in prison anyway, so refusing the sentence
suspension terms would save everyone a great deal of time and effort."

"Thank you for sharing your thoughts.", Kaia said, "but I think we're all
going to agree to the terms."

"Accepting the terms will be extremely bothersome for everyone. First, we would
have to deal with the disavowal statements. Then, you all will have to go
through the initiation ceremony, find community service opportunities, and
complete the required community service hours in addition to your studies."

"That honestly sounds better than going to prison.", Lita said.

"If you accept the terms, I can assure you that high school will be a living
hell for you. Given the events that occurred today, it is almost certain that
you will be ostracized by your peers and targeted by bullies. It won't be too
long before you will be wishing for peace and quiet of the penal system."

"Why are you trying so hard to convince us to refuse?", Dela asked.

"Your chances of success in high school are close to non-existent and your
chances of finding employment after high school are even lower. Even if you do
everything perfectly, you will still end up in prison sooner or later after
prolonged unemployment. The automatic background checks will always point the
recordings from the ceremony today. Do you really think anyone would want to
hire you after seeing what happened?"

The Principal replayed the recordings of the ceremony on the walls of his
office.

"I've seen a lot of students go through this school and I can always predict
which students will end up as prison laborers. Well, since the vast majority of
public school students end up in the penal system, I would be correct most of
the time even if I blindly guessed that everyone would go to prison.
Nevertheless, you can trust me when I say by accepting the terms you will only
be setting yourselves up for disappointment."

"It's better to try and fail, then to never try at all.", Lita said.

"I disagree. The penal system is really not that bad. Plenty of people go to
prison voluntarily to avoid the perils of a life in poverty. In prison, you
will be guaranteed ample food, water, heat, and oxygen, as long as you work. I
hear weightlessness is great fun and the views are majestic. After a few years
in prison, you will become physiologically adapted to space and you won't even
want to return to Earth."

"If it's so great, why don't you go?", Dela asked sarcastically.

The Principal cleared his throat nervously.

"I am needed here. My sacred duty of molding young minds is of utmost
importance. Of course, I also cannot abandon my dear son Pert."

The Principal called up an image of a young man flexing his muscles and
sticking out his tongue.

"That's the guy who was heckling us during the ceremony!", Lita exclaimed.

"He is quite the precocious young man.", the Principal said fondly.

"If your son were in our situation, would you recommend that he enter the penal
system too?", Kaia asked.

"Of course not!", the Principal shouted, turning red and getting flustered.

"Pertik has a bright future ahead of him! I would never send him to rot in
that-"

The Principal stopped when he realized that he was hurting his own argument.

"Don't you think it might be better to accept the terms, Dela?", Kaia asked.

"Fine, I'll accept, but that doesn't mean I'm going to be friends with you two
losers.", Dela huffed.

"I can tell we're going to get along swimmingly.", Lita quipped.

"We are ready to sign the statements.", Kaia said to the Principal, trying to
move things along before Dela had a chance to change her mind.

"I truly believe you are making a mistake.", the Principal said shaking his head.

Seeing that the girls were adamant, the Principal sighed and brought up three
copies of the disavowal statement on the desk, one in front of each girl.

"Go ahead and sign, but don't come complaining to me when you inevitably fail."

The three girls started scrolling through statements, carefully reading each
word.

Kaia finished reading first. "Why does the-"

"The statement text is non-negotiable.", the Principal said sharply, cutting Kaia off.

"But I don't under-"

"If your families could afford attorneys, they would have paid into your school
accounts. It is not my job to explain legalese to you. I told you that
accepting the terms was going to be a huge burden on everyone!"

After going over the statement again, Kaia placed her palms on the desk to sign
the statement. A few moments later, Lita did the same. The two girls turned
their attention to Dela, who was staring at the statement with clenched fists.

When Dela noticed the other two girls looking at her, she exploded.

"This is bull-"

"Just sign it already, so we can get out of here!", Lita pleaded.

Dela slammed her palms on the desk to sign the statement and proceeded to kick
the desk repeatedly.

"That's real mahogany!", the Principal lamented.

"Come on. Help me lift Kaia.", Lita said pulling Dela with one hand and
covering herself with the other hand.

As soon as Lita got up from her chair, the Principal became entranced and soon
forgot about any damage that his desk might have sustained.

Exiting the Principal's office required a team effort. It took all of Kaia's
strength just to hold onto the other girls. With Lita trying to cover herself,
it was up to Dela to open the door. As soon as they made it past the door, they
were greeted by a familiar voice.

"Hey guys, who ordered the lesbo sandwich with butch bread?"

A handful of boys started laughing and exchanging high-fives in front of the
office door. The boy had been waiting for the three girls to exit. The girls
recognized that the boy speaking to them was Pert.

"If you play your cards right, I might add some of my special sauce to your crappy
sandwich."

The boys went berserk with laughter.

"You had all that time since the ceremony and that was the best you could come
up with?" Dela asked.

Looking over at Lita, Kaia noticed that her friend was having a seizure. Kaia
watched powerlessly as the hand that was covering Lita's chest drifted down in
the front of her.

"Look fellas, this one is ready for me.", said Pert as he moved forward with
his hands reaching out towards Lita's chest. Dela swung at Pert with her free
hand, while kicking him in the shins. Kaia tried to pull Lita back away from
Pert, but was too weak to move Lita very far. Kaia opened her mouth to scream
for help, but before she could make a sound, a historianHummingbird crashed
into the side of Pert's face, sending him crashing to the floor.

Dela gave Pert one more kick before pulling the other two girls through the
semicircle of stunned boys. After Lita recovered, she was dazed and confused,
but she understood the need to run. Kaia's feet could barely keep from dragging
on the ground while the other two girls carried her down the hallway.

"Let's head to the theater.", Dela said, "It's dark inside and there are plenty
of places to hide."

Once inside the theater, the girls got up on the stage and hid behind the
curtains, trying to catch their breath. They were all tired, but still very
much on-edge. They all jumped when they noticed a set of four glowing eyes, in
the same configuration as a brown recluse spider, staring at the them. From the
darkness, a sweet voice rang out.

"Sorry to startle you. No one ever comes to visit us. Please wait one moment
while we turn on the lights. You might want to cover your eyes until they
adjust.", said a sweet voice.

When the lights came on, the girls saw a boy and girl, dressed in matching black
jumpsuits. The boy seemed very awkward and reserved, while the girl carried
herself with confidence.

"Welcome to the theater!" , the girl proclaimed with a flourish.

"What the hell are you?", Dela said sharply.

"Apologies, I am not sure what you mean.", the girl replied.

"Your eyes were glowing in the dark.", Lita explained.

"And you looked like a spider." Kaia added.

"I can assure you that we are not spiders.", the girl replied.

"Why do your eyes glow in the dark?", Lita persisted.

"I think you were seeing things. Sometimes when people are afraid of the dark,
their minds play tricks on them.", the girl replied.

"Cut the crap. We all saw it." Dela said advancing menacingly towards the girl.
"You're Lunkers, aren't you? If you try to lie to us-"

"You mustn't tell anyone anything!", the girl replied.

"It makes sense that Lunkers would want to work in a dark theater. It must
remind you of home.", Lita offered.

"Explain the spider eyes.", Dela said letting go of Kaia and holding up two
fingers on each hand next to her eyes.

After realizing what Dela meant, the boy and girl put their arms around each
other and tilted their heads together.

"We walk together like this because it enhances our night vision.", the girl
explained.

"You two look really cute together.", Lita said smiling at them warmly.

"Ha, I think the night vision enhancement isn't the only reason they can't keep
their hands off of each other.", Dela said laughing.

The boy and the girl separated, looking very embarrassed.

"We are brother and sister!", the boy blurted out.

Dela did not relent. "Oh, you two are naughty! Is incest normal for Lunkers?"

"Stop it, Dela.", Kaia said, kicking her.

"What are your names?", Lita said, trying to smooth things over.

"My name is Aira.", said the girl.

"I am Ryn.", said the boy.

"I'm Lita, this is Kaia, and next to her is Dela. Nice to meet you both. I'd
shake your hands, but my hands are full.", Lita said.

"Don't say it.", Dela warned.

"Do you want me to lend you a shirt from the theater?" Aira said to Lita.

Lita nodded emphatically.

"Do you want to come with me to dressing room so you can try a few things on?"

Lita looked at Kaia. "Kaia is hurt, do you have a place she can rest?"

"Yeah, I would love to not have to lug this loser around anymore.", Dela added.

"Yes, there is, but you mustn't tell anyone anything.", Aira said.

"We get the idea.", Dela said flatly, "We're not going to tell anyone anything."

"Ok, Ryn and I built a secret bed so we could sleep in the theater during
breaks from work."

During the awkward silence that ensued, Kaia saw Lita was tempted to make a
joke but held back. Unlike Lita, Dela couldn't resist.

"You have a secret bed? That you built yourselves, so you could sleep together?
Is that a normal thing for Lunkers?", Dela asked smiling mischievously.

Ryn was so embarrassed, he started to stammer. Dela didn't relent.

"How long have you been sleeping together? Is the sleep still good? Are you
doing anything to spice it up? Trying out a new pillow, maybe?"

Kaia was furious. "They're trying to help us and you keep bullying them!"

"Ryn, show Dela and Kaia were the bed is hidden. I'll take Lita to the dressing
room."

"We saw the recording of the ceremony today. We think you are all very brave.",
Ryn said trying to diffuse the situation. "I thought the gigaphone you built
was great. I like making things too.", Ryn said to Dela shyly.

Dela waited until Lita and Aira were out of earshot. "Have you built any
special recently? Maybe a device to help your sister sleep?" Dela continued,
"Something to knock her out so you can knock her up!"

"Stop it!", Kaia yelled.

"When you sleep together, does she snore really loud? Do you have to cover her
mouth to keep the whole school from hearing?"

"That's enough!", Kaia screamed pushing Dela away. Not having the strength to
stand on her own, Kaia fell to her knees. Dela was not done yet.

"Kaia, are you sure you even want to lay down in the secret bed? It must be
covered with sleep stains!"

Kaia began to cry, feeling powerless to stop Dela.

"When's the last time you cleaned the sheets? Wait, have you ever cleaned the
sheets? I bet we can find it just by the smell!"

Ryn helped Kaia to her feet and started walking with her in the direction of the secret bed.

"Have you ever been this close to a girl that wasn't your sister? Be careful,
Ryn, your sister might get jealous! She's used to having you all to herself,
she might not like sharing you with Kaia."

Dela continued to taunt Ryn all the way to secret bed. Lita and Aira were
already there waiting for them.

"What took you so long? I was worried", Lita said.

Kaia didn't respond, she just looked angrily at Dela. Sensing the tension, Lita
tried to change the subject.

"How do I look?", Lita asked.

Lita twirl and struck a pose. She was wearing a long flowing shirt
covered by an elegant bodice. The sight of Lita took Kaia's breath away.

"Like a guardGorilla in a milk maid outfit.", Dela said.

"What is it with you?", Kaia screamed lunging at Dela. Dela stepped away
effortlessly. Kaia stumbled and fell, landing on her hands and knees.

"Looks like I hit a nerve! I've been making fun of Ryn for ages without much of a
response. Then, I say one harmless thing about Lita and Kaia flips out."

"Sorry Ryn, looks like Kaia only cares about Lita, I guess you are stuck with
your sister for now."

Kaia couldn't hear Dela anymore over the howling wind tearing through the
theater. Sifting through the dust on the floor with her fingers, Kaia pulled
out assorted fragments of bone and shook them in her hand like dice. Through
the dust swirling around Kaia, she saw the metallic glint of the taserTutor.
The metallic tendrils extending from taserTutor were coiled around her arms up
to the shoulder. The ceremony was still ongoing. The taserTutor began to pulse
red. Kaia's heart sunk. Had she imagined everything? Dela, the Principal, Pert,
Ryn, Aira? Lightning shot out of the surrounding storm and coursed through
Kaia's body. Kaia screamed and writhed on the ground, but then got up with a
renewed sense of purpose.

Did she have a chance to change the future? If she answered the remaining
questions, could she turn everything around? Kaia knew what she had to do. She
would continue through the ceremony, deny any political motivations, blame
everything on her mental illness, and anything else she needed to do to keep
Lita safe, even if it meant that Dela would go to prison for years. Kaia began
to feverishly work on the problem displayed on the console.

She nearly finished with the task when the tendrils started restricting her
movements and moving up past her shoulder. The tendrils wrapped her neck and
around her head. She braced her legs against the taserTutor and pushed as hard
as she could, trying to break free of the tendrils. New tendrils extended out
of taserTutor wrapping around her legs. Before long, Kaia was encased head to
foot in tendrils. The tendrils constricted, squeezing all of the moisture out
of her body. When the final drop of blood disappeared in the swirling dust
below, Kaia had been squeezed dry and her mummification was complete.

Roving the desolate wasteland of Mars, Kaia was a vengeful spirit in search of
her next victim. She hunted the new invaders, the ones who desecrated the
remains of her people in search of riches. When the invaders began to arrive
with greater frequency, she raised an army of the dead to repel them. Sitting
victorious atop her throne, she waited for the next opportunity to fertilize
the barren soil of Mars with blood of her enemies. This is was Kaia's fate.
This is how she would remain. In a perpetual cycle of death and waiting, Kaia
would protect the memory of her lost civilization from each new crop of fools
who sought to strike gold on the red planet.

Disturbed by an unfamiliar sensation on her forehead, the mummy queen let out
her anger in a roar that shook the ground. After probing her face with an
tendril-covered hand, she inspected her hand and was stunned to see that her
fingers were moist. Where had the moisture come from? She had not had even a
drop of blood in her for eons, she was dessicated to the core. What was going
on? Tiny drops of water were falling down on the mummy queen's face wherever
she went. How could there be rain on Mars? She looked up and saw the
constellations rearranging into a face that filled the heavens. The mummy queen
recognized the face in the stars. It was Lita. The raindrops were coming from
her.

"Come back to me, please.", the sky whispered. It was no use. There was nothing
left of Kaia. The mummy queen was not going to spring back to life from a few
drops of water! The sky sighed and began to squeeze the horizons until the land
where the mummy queen stood disappeared completely and the mummy queen was left
floating in the void. The constellations warped and stretched until they formed
a single brilliant ball of light. The ball of light grew arms, legs, and a
head, taking the form of Lita. Lita reached her hand out to the mummy queen and
the tendrils began to break apart, revealing the dried out cadaver underneath.

"Kaia.", Lita said. "Yes", the mummy queen thought, "that was once my name. In
a past life? Or a future one?"

The light began to burn away her parched skin and brittle bones. Beneath it
all, a dim flicker of light began to shine. Could I still be saved? Lita cupped
her hands around the flicker and blew into it gently. Each time Lita blew into
her hands, the flicker grew stronger, eventually growing into a flame. As Lita
drew in breath, Kaia reached out from inside the flame and gently touched the
sides of Lita's face. When Lita leaned into blow on the flame again, Kaia
pulled her in and kissed her on the lips, sucking her life giving breathe deep
into her lungs.

Kaia's body convulsed on the hard concrete floor of the theater. She was
hyperventilating, in a panic. Lita lifted Kaia's head up off the ground and
cradled it in her arms. She smoothed Kaia's hair with one hand and supported
Kaia's neck with the other. Soon the convulsions were replaced by shivers and
Kaia's eyes focused on Lita's face. Still trembling, Kaia looked up at Lita.
Tears were falling from Lita's eyes onto Kaia's face.

"Is she alive?", Dela asked impatiently.

"Yes. No thanks to you.", Lita replied sharply.

"Let's get her into bed.", Aira said.

Kaia was underwater, looking up at Lita in the stars above. An octopus obscured
the view of the sky and Kaia tried to shoo it away, but it extended four pairs
of tentacles towards Kaia and carried her with to onto a tuft of seaweed. Kaia
suddenly felt very grateful to the octopus. Reaching out her hands, she began
to caress the tentacles. The tentacles began to reciprocate. Kaia was
blissfully exchanging caresses with the octopus when she had a startling
thought. If I'm underwater, how is it that I'm breathing? Kaia shot up,
throwing the tentacles off of her, and gasping for air.

"It's ok, Kaia.", Lita said reassuringly, "You're safe now."

Lita laid down next to Kaia in the bed, cradling Kaia in her arms. Kaia buried
her face in Lita's shirt just above the bodice. The smell of the starchy shirt
mixing with Lita's scent was heavenly. Soon Kaia stopped trembling and her body
relaxed. Kaia lifted her face up to look at Lita. Lita was so radiant and
beautiful that Kaia began to cry.

Lita leaned in a kissed Kaia's cheeks, catching the fresh tears with her lips.
Kaia fell asleep with a smile on her face as Lita slowly showered her with
kisses. The blissful look on Kaia's face warmed Lita's heart. They were
together. They were safe, at least for now. The world melted away. Lita did not
realize how she was exhausted until now. With one arm still around Kaia, Lita
tugged futilely at the bindings of her bodice.

"Let me help you", Aira said, as she deftly undid the bindings of the bodice
and pulled it out from under Lita. This kind gesture surprised Lita so much
that she began to cry. Through the tears, Lita looked at Aira with gratitude.

"Don't cry.", Aira said, unfastening and removing Lita's heels and then pulling
up the blankets to cover Kaia and Lita, "You're safe here and I'll stay and
watch over you."

Unable to recall anyone other than Kaia being kind to her, Lita let out a sob.
Afraid she had said something wrong, Aira stepped backwards.

"I'm going to turn off the lights."

As the theater descended into darkness, Lita snuggled up to Kaia, greedily
interlacing their legs and pulling Kaia closer with her arms. Recalling how
Kaia often breathed in deep when they hugged, Lita rested her nose on top of
Kaia's head and filled her lungs with the scent of Kaia's hair. The darkness
around Lita exploded with a kaleidoscope of shimmering colors. With another
breath, Lita began to float in between the colors as they gently twinkled
around her. By the third breath, Lita was in another plane of existence
entirely, gently drifting off to sleep in the arms of her lifelong best friend.
