# Off to a great start

Kaia would have given anything to be normal. Filled with dread and paralyzed by
anxiety, she wished she could be carefree like the other students in the
cacophonous gymnasium. The polyethylene bleachers were packed with the entire
college freshman class. All around the bleachers, robotic animals buzzed,
growled, and roared, while observing the students. There was no way out.

Kaia leaned in to her best friend Sata and whispered in her ear. "Let's run."

Sata shook her head vigorously, but her thick mane of reddish brown hair barely
moved. "We wouldn't even make it to the door, which is locked by the way."

Kaia tucked her hair behind her ears and leaned in further. "If we run, they'd
have to knock us out, and we'd miss the ceremony."

Sata gestured towards the walls of the gymnasium. "If the BuzzBees knocked us
out, the WakeupWasps would sting us until we were awake." The gymnasium walls
were covered with trypophobia-inducing hexagonal holes. Inside the walls, there
was a network of tunnels filled with robotic insects always ready to swarm
anyone who stepped out of line.

Kaia gently tugged on Sata's shirt sleeve. "Maybe if we act crazy, they'd knock
us out to keep us from disrupting the ceremony." Sata was wearing her favorite
pink shirt. The shirt had a design featuring voluptuous manga catgirls^[The
Japanese word for catgirl is nekomusume] hanging with nooses around their necks
while vomiting rainbows.

"Acting crazy should be easy for you, because you've always been insane." Sata
ruffled Kaia's hair, knowing full well that it made Kaia mad. Unlike Sata, Kaia
meticulously straightened her hair and brushed it obsessively. Kaia smoothed
her hair and adjusted her hair clips. Each hair clip was decorated with a dead
mouse design. The mice were sticking out their tongues and had X's for eyes.

Sata could see that her joke had not landed well, so she tried to reassure her
friend. "Maybe it won't be so bad. Maybe I won't have a seizure and you won't
freak out."

Kaia tilted her head and struck a kawaii^[Kawaii is the Japanese word for cute]
pose. "Awww, you always know exactly what to say to keep me from freaking
out. Have you ever thought of becoming a motivational speaker?" Kaia's facial
features were tiny, but her eyes and forehead were large. Kaia knew that her
small face and stature made her look much younger than she was, and she often
acted sweet and innocent to hide her sarcasm.

Sata smiled and put her arm around Kaia, pretending to put her into a
headlock. Kaia feigned distress while trying to wrestle free, but before long
her head was resting on Sata's shoulder and the two girls embraced. Kaia
pressed her cheek against the rainbow vomit that flowed down Sata's shirt
sleeves in lines as straight as Kaia's hair. Sata looked over at Kaia and
enjoyed coloristic contrast between Kaia's hair and the rainbow vomit. Kaia had
purple hair which was so muted that it was almost grey. Her hair sent the mixed
message of wanting to blend in and being desperate for attention.

Several students noticed that Kaia and Sata were hugging. They moved closer and
started to jeer.

"Get a room, you two!"

"Looks like the sexual tension was too much for them!"

"Which one is butch? And what do you call the other one?"

Kaia wondered if she was imagining the jeers until she felt Sata tense up and
eventually withdraw from their embrace. For as long as she could remember, Kaia
had auditory hallucinations. She sometimes had trouble differentiating between
the voices of people around her and the voices in her head. _Some voices are
easier to differentiate than others. You're the only voice that narrates
everything that happens to me,_ Kaia thought, proving that she was totally nuts
by responding to an auditory hallucination.

To make matters worse, Kaia often had strange dreams at night and weird visions
during the day. The dreams and visions seemed so real and familiar that it
sometimes took Kaia a long time to reacclimatize to reality.

Kaia looked down at her shirt. Her shirt was white with a design of a dead
mouse surrounded by snow. She liked the dead mouse designs on her hair clips
and shirt, because they made her sad but in a good way. Kaia pulled on her
shirt subconsciously. When the shirt moved, it looked like the snow was falling
and the mouse was in its death throes.

The jeering eventually subsided, but Kaia and Sata remained apart, sitting
quietly. The college Provost walked up to the podium in front of the
bleachers. Suddenly, the gymnasium fell quiet. Even the robotic animals were
silent as the Provost cleared his throat and prepared to speak.

Already sweating, the portly Provost wiped his brow with a lace handkerchief
he retrieved from the pocket of his blazer. With three clicks of his tongue,
the Provost summoned three robotic bees. The BuzzBees landed on the
Provost's face and neck and used their stingers to administer the
pharmacological assistance that the Provost would need to assemble his frayed
nerves.

"Today we welcome a new cohort of-"

A student with blue-green hair jumped on top of her seat on the bleachers and
began to shout into a hand-held gigaphone. The sound was deafeningly loud.

"Corporeal punishment is barbaric and ineffective!"

"TaserTutors are torture!"

"Reform the education system!"

A ChaseChimpanzee jumped down from the rafters and tackled the student,
knocking the gigaphone out of her hand. The protester was up in an instant, and
began to punch and kick the ChaseChimpanzee. The ChaseChimpanzee struck back,
but the protester seemed to holding her own, until a GuardGorilla knocked her
to the ground. Even on the ground, the protester continued kicking and punching
the SecuritySimians. The GuardGorilla scooped up the protester, pinning her
arms at the sides. As she was carried out of the gymnasium, the protester
flailed her legs and shouted political slogans.

Visibly shaken, the Provost repeated his pre-speech ritual by clearing his
throat again and clicking his tongue three more times. The three additional
robotic bee stings successfully calmed the Provost, but when he resumed his
speech, he was swaying side to side, gripping the podium for support, and
having difficulty speaking clearly.

"Dishipline and respet for aufority are eshenshial for a funshioning shosh-"
The principal suddenly lurched forward and vomited all over the podium. Wiping
his mouth with the sleeve of his blazer, the Provost wrapped up his speech.
"Let the sheremony begin!"

An automated voice started calling students to participate in the
initiation ceremony. The gymnasium erupted with the excited chatter of the
students and the sounds of the robotic wildlife.

Kaia leaned in to whisper to Sata again, but stopped when she noticed that her
friend was having a seizure. Sata's expressionless face moved ever so slightly
as she blankly stared into the distance. When she realized that the seizure was
relatively mild and that Sata would recover shortly, Kaia let out a sigh of
relief. While waiting for her friend to recover, Kaia held Sata's hands, which
unfortunately attracted the attention of nearby students.

"I think she's about to propose!"

"Is that even legal?"

"The SecuritySimians should arrest those two!"

After seeing it countless times, Kaia knew exactly what to expect. As the
seizure ended, Sata looked around disoriented and confused. The part that
always broke Kaia's heart was when Sata looked embarrassed about having a
seizure. Sata pulled her hands away. Never knowing what to say, Kaia tried to
start a conversation.

"What do you think will happen to the protester?"

"She's going to get kicked out of college."

"How do you know?"

"She didn't go through the initiation rite."

"Maybe we can protest too?"

Clearly not in the mood to continue the conversation, Sata did not reply. Sata
was nervous about their first day of college. Neither of them ever fit in at
school. Thinking about her friendship with Sata, Kaia wondered if the only
reason that they were friends was because they were both abnormal. Would they
still be friends if Sata was not epileptic? Or would Sata prefer to spend time
with friends who did not hear and see things that were not there? How could
Kaia possibly compete with friends that were normal?

_That's mean,_ Kaia thought, criticizing her own internal monologue. _I know
you get to choose what to narrate, so I would appreciate it if you could skip
the super insecure thoughts._ `No way, Kaia, your insecurities are central to
your story.` _When I was a little kid, you used to talk to me and help me all
the time. Why are you such a jerk now?_ Kaia asked, assuming incorrectly that
the narrator in her head was Ryt, the imaginary friend Kaia remembered from her
childhood. _If you're not Ryt, then who are you?_ Kaia demanded futilely. _If
you don't at least tell me your name, I'm going to spend the rest of my life in
quiet meditation and you won't have anything to narrate._

Kaia's empty threat to boycott her own life was especially useless given that
her name had just been called. Realizing that it was her turn to participate in
the initiation rite, Kaia froze in panic. Sata nudged Kaia and gestured for her
to stand up. Desperate for a means of escape, Kaia looked pleadingly at
Sata. Trying her best to be reassuring, Sata smiled weakly and gave Kaia a
gesture of encouragement. Left with no other option, Kaia got up and started to
squeeze through the rows of students.

Kaia could feel the eyes of the students and robotic animals follow her to the
TaserTutor next to the podium in front of the bleachers. The TaserTutor looked
like a metal altar covered with a silvery hair. As she approached, the metallic
wires covering the TaserTutor began to writhe. The TaserTutor shrunk down to
match Kaia's height.

Robotic birds, bats, and bugs flew in circles above Kaia. A wall of
HistorianHummingbirds hovered in front of her face, recording her every move
from multiple angles, staring at her with their piercing eyes, relaying
everything they saw to the display system on the walls of the gymnasium.

When Kaia placed her palms down on the TaserTutor, metallic tendrils extended
from the TaserTutor and wrapped around her arms up to the shoulders like vines
around a tree. The automated voice that had called Kaia's name earlier began to
deliver commands.

"State your full name."

"Kaiakelaaila Erkadia."

"State your age in years."

"18."

"List the three branches of Government."

"The CorporateCouncil, the DemocraticDelegation, and the EternalEnlightened."

So far so good, but the next questions would be much more difficult.

"Given an average distance of 382 megameters, calculate the time in seconds
required for a radio transmission to go from the surface of Earth to its moon
and back."

Kaia thought about the task while typing it out using the virtual keyboard on
the TaserTutor.

_Distance: 382 megameters._

_Speed of light: 300 megameters per second._

_Time: 382 / 300 seconds = 1.27 seconds_

Kaia opened her mouth to answer, but froze in horror. _And back!_ Kaia said to
herself. _From Earth to the moon AND BACK!_

Terrified at the thought that she almost answered incorrectly, Kaia did the
final calculation in her head. "2.54 seconds!" Kaia braced for an electric
shock, but was relieved to hear the next task instead.

"Given a distance range of 590 to 980 gigameters, calculate the minimum time in
minutes required for a radio transmission to go from the surface of Earth to
Jupiter."

Kaia's head was spinning. She pushed through the vertigo and began to dissect
the task. _No 'and back' this time. 'Minimum' means 590 gigameters._

_Distance: 590 gigameters_
_Speed of light: 18 gigameters per minute_
_Time: 590 / 18 seconds ..._

"32.78 minutes."

The pressure was getting to Kaia. She loved math, but hated solving word
problems under threat of electric shock while everyone was watching. Luckily,
the next task was related to geology.

"Which mineral group is the most abundant in Earth's crust and what are its
three endmembers?

"The feldspars are the most abundant. The endmembers are potassium feldspar,
albite, and anorthite."

"Construct a representation of the chemical structure of any feldspar."

The display on the TaserTutor transformed from a keyboard into the periodic
chart of elements. On top of each square on the chart was a sphere that
represented an element. Kaia took a deep breathe. Chemistry was one of her
favorite subjects. All she had to do was stay focused.

Kaia used the display to enter the number of atoms of each she would need. Each
time she entered a number, a new set of spheres appeared in front of her. In
total, Kaia had 4 potassium atoms, 4 aluminum atoms, 12 silicon atoms, and 42
oxygen atoms.

Kaia began arranging the spheres. The metallic tendrils extending from the
TaserTutor stretched as she moved her hands from sphere to sphere. First, Kaia
arranged 4 oxygen atoms into a tiny pyramid. Next, Kaia made a ring of 4
pyramids by adding 8 more oxygen atoms, 3 for each new pyramid except the last
one, which only needed 2. Another 10 oxygen atoms were enough to make another
identical ring that was connected to the first ring by two oxygen atoms. Then,
Kaia used the last 20 oxygen atoms to create another identical pair of rings
beneath the first. After creating the 4 rings of pyramids, Kaia put an aluminum
or silicon atom in the middle of each of the 16 pyramids. Finally, Kaia put a
potassium atom below the structure, another one below, and the final two
potassium atoms in opposites corners of the middle of the structure.

"This is the chemical structure of the basic subunit of potassium feldspar with
ten additional oxygen atoms to completely surround each aluminum and silicon
atom."

Kaia was out of breath and sweating. Her arms felt like they were made of
feldspar. She was so exhausted that she almost did not care if she answered
correctly or not. The pressure was getting to her. It had not occurred to Kaia
that it would have been sufficient to create a single ring of pyramids and
stick a potassium next to it.

_Stop it, you're distracting me!_ Kaia thought, casting serious doubt on the
durability of her mental state.

"Describe the mineral composition of the Martian crust."

"The crust of Mars includes volcanic rock minerals such as feldspars,
pyroxenes, and olivine."

"Explain the origin of nanomaterials on the surface of Mars.

"The nanostructures originate from the two sources: the ancient Martian
civilization-"

Kaia stopped mid-sentence. She felt like her mouth was filled with Martian
dust. A pulsing red light warned Kaia that pauses were not allowed.

"-and Thelusian spacecrafts that collided with Mars during the
Martian-Thelusian War."

Kaia looked up. The sky, once dark with orbiting spacecrafts, lit up as the
entire Thelusian armada began to enter the thin Martian atmosphere.

"Describe how the leader of each branch of government are selected."

People all around Kaia began to run for cover, but she knew there was nowhere
to hide. Everyone was running and screaming except for her and Sata. _What is
Sata doing here on Mars?_ Kaia wondered. With an alarmed and desperate look on
her face, Sata pointed down in front of Kaia. Unsure why Sata was pointing down
and not up at impending cataclysm in the sky, Kaia turned her gaze down toward
the pulsing red light emanating from the metallic table. `Kaia, you know
this. Everyone knows this. The CorporateCouncil is led by the person with the
highest net worth. The leader of the DemocraticDelegation is the person with
the highest number of social media followers. The EternalEnlightened vote to
determine their own leader.` Kaia opened her mouth, but instead of words, dust
poured out. She tried to type out the answer, but the console quickly became
covered in dust. The red light pulsed faster and faster until it became
continuous. Kaia had run out of time. Her body shook with electricity.

The TaserTutor mercilessly continued on to the next task. "Given that the
Venusian orbital period is 225 days, calculate how many days would pass before
Earth and Venus would return to their current positions^[225 * 365 / 5 =
16425]." `Kaia, the answer is in the footnote. Come on, Kaia, snap out of
it. You eat harder tasks than this for breakfast. The least common multiple of
the orbital periods is their product divided by their greatest common
denominator. Just say or write 45 * 365 = 16425!`

Kaia was having trouble maintain her footing. Beneath her feet, countless
skeletons were crumbling into dust. The dust began to swirl in a circle around
Kaia, as a ferocious wind built up into a raging storm. In the eye of the
storm, Kaia stood staring at the remnants of an extinguished world. When
lightning shot out of storm and struck Kaia, she screamed, not in pain, but in
anger.

With the loss of an entire civilization weighing down on her, Kaia fell to her
knees. She began to sink down as the Martian dust started to consume her like
quicksand. The electric shocks that wracked her body seemed insignificant
compared to the genocide of her people. There was nothing she could to save
them. They had all died thousands of years ago. Sata reached down into the dust
and tried to pull Kaia out. Despite Sata's best efforts, Kaia slid further down
into a dark abyss of despair.

Instinctively, Kaia took one last gulp of air before her head was
covered. Unimpeded by the dust, the electricity had no trouble finding
her. After her grip on Sata's hand slipped, Kaia became completely surround by
dust. Two meters below the surface, Kaia became very still as she gave in to
the crushing weight of her destroyed world.

`Kaia, get up. Your initiation rite is still ongoing. Kaia, please stand
up. Listen, you were right all along, Kaia. My name is Nara. I was tasked with
narrating your story after Ryt was recycled. Please, Kaia, don't give in. Ryt
told me that he loved you like the daughter he could never have. He said he did
not regret anything and that the time he spent with you was worth being
recycled. I think I am beginning to understand how he felt. Ryt wouldn't have
wanted you to die like this and I don't either. You need to breathe, Kaia. You
need to survive.`

Remembering Ryt, Kaia began to struggle against the dust. `Yes, Kaia, you can
do it!` Clawing her way back up to surface, Kaia emerged and took a deep
breath. Ryt had been Kaia's friend since she was a baby, long before she even
met Sata. Kaia started talking later than most toddlers, because she became
accustomed to communicating with Ryt using her thoughts. In fact, Kaia often
became frustrated that no one else could hear her thoughts or understand her as
well as Ryt could.

Ryt had explained to Kaia that she was the only one who could hear narration
and that she should keep her gift hidden. Kaia learned at very early age that
her gift was not entirely positive. Whenever she was around other people, Kaia
would hear their narrators in addition to her own. It was worst when large
groups of people were talking. The voices of the narrators and people would
blend together and make it difficult for Kaia to understand what anyone was
saying.

Sitting in the packed bleachers surrounded by chattering students had been hell
for Kaia. It was all she could do to focus on Sata's voice over the din of
narration and chatter. Through the swirling dust storm, Kaia began to see the
pulsing red warning light of of the TaserTutor and the glint of the metallic
tendrils wrapped around her arms. Another shock from the tendrils caused Kaia
to spasm and she hit her head on the TaserTutor. Sata appeared again at Kaia's
side and helped her stand up.

Kaia propped herself on the TaserTutor and looked down at the console. There
was no way to stop the initiation rite once it had begun and breaking free from
the tendrils was impossible. The automated voice continued providing
instructions, but Kaia was no longer paying attention. The initiation ceremony
seemed so insignificant when compared to the destruction of Mars. Kaia just
wanted it to end. As the TaserTutor once again begun to pulse red, Kaia used
the virtual keyboard to skip the current task.

The resulting electric shock only added to the fury that Kaia felt. `Kaia,
skipping tasks is not a good idea.` _Shut up, I don't care. I just want this to
be over._ As soon as she could control her fingers again, Kaia began skipping
task after task, pushing through each subsequent electric shock. Her ears were
ringing. Tears were streaming down her face. Her breathing was hoarse and
uneven. The burning smell was suffocating. Her mouth tasted as if her tongue
was coated with metal. Rage was the only thing keeping her going.

Even after the console stopped responding and the tendrils began to unwrap from
around her arms, Kaia kept trying to skip. `Kaia, the rite is done. You need to
look behind you.` Leaning against the TaserTutor for support and still focused
on the console, Kaia was an easy target for the ChaseChimpanzee charging
towards her. The ChaseChimpanzee tackled Kaia into TaserTutor so hard that she
bounced off and ended up sprawled on the floor. A GuardGorilla lumbered up to
Kaia, grabbed her by an ankle, and proceeded to drag her out of the gymnasium.

As she was dragged past the bleachers, Kaia searched for Sata in the sea of
students. The automated voice was already calling the next student up to the
TaserTutor. Sata pushed through the densely packed crowd of students, leapt off
the bleachers, and ran towards Kaia. When she was a steps away from Kaia, a
nearby GuardGorilla grabbed Sata by her shirt and plucked her off the ground.
Simultaneously kicking and punching the GuardGorilla, Sata fought to break
free. Reaching her hand out to Sata, Kaia tried to say her name, but the sound
that came out was nothing more than a pitiful moan.

Suspended in the air, Sata prepared for a daring escape by bracing her legs
against the GuardGorilla that was carrying her and gripping both sides of the
neckline of her shirt. As she tore her shirt down the middle, Sata pushed off
the GuardGorilla like a Olympic swimmer completing a flip turn. Angling her
arms backwards to slide out of the shirt sleeves, Sata landed flat on her
chest. Sata's brassiere was pink, like her shirt, but a thin band of red
underneath. The brassiere's cups were decorated with decapitated heads of manga
catgirls which were dripping blood onto the brassiere's glittering red
underband and vomiting rainbows to create the brassiere's straps and
wings. Crawling on her hands and knees, Sata made it to Kaia and grabbed her
outstretched hand.

Seemingly perplexed by the situation, the GuardGorilla paused for a moment,
looking at the torn pink shirt in its hand. Still holding the ripped remains of
Sata's shirt with one hand, the GuardGorilla grabbed Sata's foot with the other
other hand and tried to pull the two friends apart. As the GuardGorillas yanked
from both ends, Sata held on to Kaia's hands with all her strength. When Sata's
shoe came off, Kaia and Sata hit the ground, Kaia on her back, Sata on her
chest, but they remained linked. The GuardGorilla holding Sata's shirt and
shoe, looked back and forth between the two items. Its programming had not
prepared it for this kind of situation. The shoe in the GuardGorilla's hand was
a ballerina flat decorated with manga catgirl heads bobbing in a rainbow vomit
sea of their own creation. The GuardGorilla holding Kaia's ankle seemed to grow
impatient and began to drag the daisy chain of girls out of the gymnasium.

"At least now, I won't have to go through the initiation rite," Sata joked.

Despite the direness of her situation, Kaia smiled. Sata was so brave and
strong, always looking out for Kaia and trying to cheer her up. Sata's grin
stretched across her broad face and lit up Kaia's entire world. Thinking of how
wonderful Sata was, Kaia's eyes began to well up. Seeing that her friend was
beginning to cry, Sata tried to strike a jovial tone. "Was this best plan you
could come up with?" Kaia almost snorted with laughter. "It's better than the
one with the BuzzBees and WakeupWasps."

"Yeah, I hate bugs." Sata laughed at her own joke and Kaia's heart melted. Even
being dragged shirtless through a college they would likely soon be expelled
from, Sata was defiant and beautiful. Wishing she could pull Sata closer, Kaia
became overwhelmed with emotion and broke down crying.

Sata wanted to comfort Kaia, to reach out wipe the tears from her cheeks.
"Cheer up, at least we're helping to clean to the floor. Maybe we found our
calling? I can be a broom and you can be a mop!"

When Kaia continued to cry, Sata decided to double down. "Okay, okay, you can
be the broom and I'll be the mop. Is that better?" Kaia huffed, pretending to
be exasperated. Sata took it as good sign. "Admit it. I'm funny! This is the
standup comedy show that will redefine the word 'standup'. Pretty soon every
comedian will do shows while being dragged through the venue."

Kaia rolled her eyes. Sata beamed, knowing that her strategy was working. "Did
you hear the one about the GuardGorilla, the HistorianHummingbird, and
BuzzBee?" Kaia decided to join in. "I got a better one. A ChaseChimpanzee, a
SurveillanceSloth, and a MessengerMeerkat walk into a bar..."

Sata grinned triumphantly. "There you go! Maybe we can form a comedy duo? We'll
get dragged through all the best places in town!"

When they arrived at the Provost's office, the GuardGorilla let go of Kaia's
foot and opened the door. Sata helped Kaia to her feet, put Kaia's arm around
her shoulder, and walked with her towards the office. Leaning against her
friend, Kaia became overwhelmed by the intoxicating scent of Sata's bushy,
unruly hair and almost fell over.

As they entered the office, they saw the blue-green haired protester sitting in
a chair with a GuardGorilla standing behind her. The protester was wearing a
black shirt with 'Smash the system!' written on it and a design of a hammer
smashing a machine and sending broken cogs flying in all directions.

In the opposite side of the room was a large, well-polished mahogany desk. The
college Provost was sitting behind the desk. He was snoring loudly with his head
tilted back, his mouth open, his face and neck covered in BuzzBees, and drool
flowing down the side of his chin and onto his blazer.

The protester's narrow face was swollen and covered with bruises. It was clear
that she did not go quietly when the SecuritySimians took her. Her eyes,
partially blocked by her wavy blue-green hair, widen when she saw Kaia and Sata
approach. The look on the protester's bruised face made Kaia wonder what she
and Sata looked like. Sata, shirtless and missing a shoe, was supporting Kaia,
whose hair was still standing on end from being electrocuted repeatedly. The
GuardGorilla pulled up a pair of chairs for Kaia and Sata.

Sata pretended to be puzzled by the gesture. "A brute with good manners? A
brutish gentleman?" As soon as she helped Kaia sit down in the chair closest to
door, Sata crossed her arms in front of her exposed chest and sat down in the
chair in between Kaia and the protester. Turning towards the protester, Sata
tried to start a conversation. "I think what you did in the gym was awesome!"

The protester seemed unmoved by the compliment. "What the hell happened to
you?"

Sata took a deep breath and explained in a constant stream of words. "Kaia was
really worried about the initiation rite, but then when it began she was doing
really well, but then she stopped doing the tasks, and she got fried several
times, and then she started skipping the rest of the tasks, and she got fried a
bunch more times, and then the SecuritySimians got her. I tried to rescue her,
but they got me too and brought us both here."

When the protester did not respond, Sata caught her breath and continued. "My
name is Sata. My friend is Kaia. What's your name?"

"Fera."

Sata remained friendly in the face of Fera's obvious indifference. "Hi Fera!
Nice to meet you. I'd shake your hand, but my hands are full."

Sata looked down at her arms, still crossed in front of her chest over her pink
brassiere. "Very full!" Sata exclaimed as she wiggled her shoulders and smiled
suggestively at Fera.

"Can one of you give me a hand?" Sata said looking back and forth between Fera
and Kaia. "I think I'm more woman than any one person can handle."

"Is she always like this?" Fera asked looking at Kaia.

Kaia shook her head. Her frazzled hair swayed from side to side. "Not always. I
think she is just happy she got to skip the initiation rite."

"Kaia got herself fried so I wouldn't have to go through it," Sata said proudly.

"How did you smuggle in that thing that made your voice really loud?" Sata
asked Fera.

"The gigaphone? I didn't smuggle it in. I built it inside the gym from pieces
of broken robotic animals."

"Where did you get the tools from?"

"I built the tools I needed from pieces of broken robotic animals."

Pre-empting the next question, Fera responded before Sata could ask.

"Don't ask me where I got the tools to build the tools I needed to build the
gigaphone."

Sata decided to ask a different question. "Can you teach me to build things?"

"I'd only teach you if you were part of the revolution."

"The revolution?"

"The revolution is a movement that will overthrow the government and build a
better world."

"How are we going to do that?"

"Anyway we can! The system of oppression that forces us to-"

As if on cue, the Provost woke up noisily, send BuzzBees flying in every
direction. Disoriented and disconcerted, he looked back and forth between the
three girls in his office. Unsure of what to do, the Provost began to tap at
the console on his desk and mumble to himself. Whenever he looked up, it was
always at Sata's chest. His gaze made her so uncomfortable, Sata shrunk back
into her chair and curled up in a ball, bringing her knees up to her chin and
wrapping her arms around her shins.

"Don't put your shoes on my furniture!" the Provost barked angrily. "What happened
to your other shoe? And what happened to your shirt?" he asked
disapprovingly. Kaia watched helplessly as Sata slipped into a
seizure. Luckily, Sata stayed in fetal position in the chair even though her
hands floated to her sides.

"Never mind, I'm pulling up the recordings," he said, losing patience quickly.

Images of the initiation ceremony showed up on the walls of the Provost's
office. Kaia shuddered when she saw herself being repeatedly electrocuted. The
visions that had been so powerful during her initiation rite now seemed so
distant and foreign. She saw that Sata tried to go to Kaia after the first few
electric shocks, but a ChaseChimpanzee pulled her back to her seat on the
bleachers.

Everyone in the room winced when they saw Kaia get tackled by a ChaseChimpanzee
into the TaserTutor. The Provost seemed to be enjoying the show. When Sata's
shirt was ripped off, he bounced in his chair with glee. After the recording
ended, he cleared his throat and put on a serious face.

"The crimes you have committed are very serious. Disruption of the peace,
unsanctioned protest, destruction of college property, indecent exposure,
resisting arrest, assault with a deadly weapon-"

"What weapon?!" Sata exclaimed incredulously.

"Gigaphones are classified as lethal weapons. And rightly so, they can produce
sounds 1000 times louder than regular megaphones. If it had been a weapon of
mass destruction like a teraphone, I could have called in a strike team and had
you executed on the spot!"

The Provost's eyes returned to the screen on his desk.

"The EternalEnlightened have reviewed the video evidence related to your case.
The results of your trial should be available any-"

"Possible mitigating circumstances?!" the Provost exclaimed, interrupting himself.

The Provost turned to Kaia. "The EternalEnlightened have asked for more
information about your interaction with the TaserTutor. Why did you skip so
many tasks? Did you suffer a psychotic break? Or were you making a statement
against corporeal punishment in the education system?"

Surprised to suddenly become the center of attention, Kaia felt her cheeks
become flushed with embarrassment. She understood the reasoning behind the
question. The college had access to all of her medical records, including her
diagnoses. Kaia looked back and forth between Sata and Fera. She wanted to be
defiant and strong like they were. She did not want mental illness to be the
reason she got into this mess. She wanted to be normal. `Kaia, I know what
you're considering. Just tell them the truth.`

"It was a protest," Kaia lied. Sata gasped. Fera nodded approvingly.

"Did you conspire with the other two girls to stage the protest?" the Provost
asked reading the question off the screen.

"I planned my protest all on my own. Sata had nothing to do with it, she's
innocent!"

The Provost huffed. "She is hardly innocent. Indecent exposure, interruption of a
government-mandated ceremony, and interference with the arrest of a protester
are serious crimes."

"Sata didn't plan for any of that to happen. She was just trying to help me."

The Provost turned towards Sata. "Is it true that you had no idea about the
protest plans and were not trying to make a political statement?"

Still using her legs to shield herself from the prying eyes of the
Provost, Sata nodded, her chin bouncing against her knees.

Turning to Fera, "Did you conspire with the other girls to stage a protest?"
the Provost asked.

"I never even met them until you brought them in here!" Fera exclaimed.

"We have the results!" the Provost shouted and then read the verdicts and
sentences one after another.

"Feravikadela Fridzia, you are found guilty of all charges and are sentenced to
four years in juvenile detention."

"Kaiakeilaila Erkadia, you are found guilty of all charges and are sentenced to
three years in juvenile detention."

"Satalitastra Azymuta, you are found guilty of all charges and are sentenced to
one year in juvenile detention."

"Well, our college careers are really off to a great start," Sata said
somberly.

The Provost continued to read. "Your sentences can be suspended and you can
be allowed to begin your college studies if you all complete the initiation
rite this afternoon, perform community service throughout your time in college,
and sign a statement disavowing all previous political statements and
activities. You each can each agree or disagree to the sentence suspension
terms, but you must make your final decision before leaving this office."

"We should all agree," Kaia said quickly, looking at the other two girls.

"I'm not going to agree to anything," Fera replied dourly.

Kaia made the sweetest face she could, complete with a quivering lip
and puppy-dog-eyes. "If you go to prison, we'll never see you again! If you
stay... maybe we can be friends?"

Fera remained adamant. "I don't want friends, I want to smash the system!"

"You can't start a revolution from inside prison," Sata said.

Fera crossed her arms. "I don't care. I stand by what I did."

While Sata kept trying to convince Fera, Kaia closed her eyes and fell back
into her chair feeling defeated. `Kaia, ask the Provost for advice.` _Why are you
suddenly trying to help to me?_ `I tried to help you during the ceremony and I
haven't been terminated yet, so I think it should be safe as long as I destroy
all of the evidence afterwards.` _Ok, but why should I ask the Provost for advice?
He doesn't seem to be on our side. I don't think he is going to give us good
advice._ `His advice might convince Fera to do the opposite of what he
suggests.` _Why do you want to help Fera?_ `If Fera goes to prison, you are
likely to feel terrible for a long time, and your prolonged depression would be
super boring to narrate.`

"Kaia, are you OK?" Sata asked, looking very concerned.

"Yes, I was just resting my eyes," Kaia said before using her sweetest and most
innocent voice to ask, "Provost Naiksos, what do you think we should do?"

The Provost had zoned out and was tapping listlessly on his desk console. He
looked up from the console and seemed to be very confused. Kaia elaborated,
trying to sound even sweeter and more innocent. "What decision do you think we
should make? Should we accept or refuse the terms?"

The Provost cleared his throat again and became very serious. "I would
encourage you to not compromise your deeply held political beliefs. It is very
likely you would all end up in prison anyway, so refusing the sentence
suspension terms would save everyone a great deal of time and effort."

"Thank you," Kaia said, "we appreciate your advice, but I think we're all going
to agree to the terms."

The Provost had the impression that Kaia was not listening. "Accepting the
terms will be extremely bothersome for everyone. First, we would have to deal
with the disavowal statements. Then, you all will have to go through the
initiation ceremony before the end of today, search for community service
opportunities, and complete the required community service hours in addition to
your studies."

"That honestly sounds better than going to prison," Sata said.

The Provost glowered disapprovingly at Sata. "If you accept the terms, I can
assure you that college will be a living hell for you. Given the events
that occurred today, it is almost certain that you will be ostracized by your
peers and targeted by bullies. It won't be too long before you will be wishing
for the peace and quiet of the penal system."

"Why are you trying so hard to convince us to refuse?" Fera asked.

The Provost tried his best to sound benevolent. "Your chances of success in
college are close to non-existent and your chances of finding employment
after college are even lower. Even if you do everything perfectly, you will
still end up in prison sooner or later after prolonged unemployment. The
automatic background checks will always point employers to the recordings from
the initiation ceremony today. Do you really think anyone would want to hire
you after seeing what happened?"

The Provost replayed the recordings of the ceremony on the walls of his
office. "I've seen countless students go through this college, and I can always
predict which students will end up in prison. Well, since the vast majority of
public college students end up in the penal system, I would be correct most of
the time even if I blindly guessed that everyone would go to
prison. Nevertheless, you can trust me, by accepting the terms you will only be
setting yourselves up for disappointment."

"It's better to try and fail, then to never try at all," Sata said.

The Provost shook his head. "I disagree. The penal system is really not as
bad as you seem to believe. Plenty of people go to prison voluntarily to avoid
the perils of a life in poverty. In prison, you will be guaranteed ample food,
water, heat, and oxygen, as long as you work. I hear weightlessness is great
fun and the views are majestic. After a few years in prison, you will become
physiologically adapted to space and you will not even want to return to
Earth."

"If it's so great, why don't you go?" Fera asked sarcastically.

The Provost cleared his throat nervously. "I am needed here. My sacred duty
of molding young minds is of utmost importance. Of course, I also cannot
abandon my dear son Dun." The Provost called up an image of a young man
flexing his muscles and sticking out his tongue.

"That's the guy who was heckling us during the ceremony!" Sata exclaimed.

"He is quite the precocious young man," the Provost said fondly.

"If your son were in our situation, would you recommend that he enter the penal
system too?" Kaia asked.

"Of course not!" the Provost shouted, turning red and getting flustered.
"Dunik has a bright future ahead of him! I would never send him to rot in
that-" The Provost stopped when he realized that he was hurting his own
argument.

"Still want reject the terms, Fera?" Kaia asked. "He wants you to refuse, so he
can send you to prison and not have to deal with you! Are you just going to
give him what he wants?"

"Fine, I'll accept, but that doesn't mean I'm going to be friends with you two
losers."

"I can tell we're going to get along swimmingly," Sata quipped.

"We are ready to sign the statements," Kaia said to the Provost, trying to
move things along before Fera had a chance to change her mind.

"I truly believe you are making a mistake," the Provost said shaking his head.
Seeing that the girls were were not going to change their minds, the Provost
sighed and brought up three copies of the disavowal statement on the desk, one
in front of each girl.

"Go ahead and sign, but don't come complaining to me when you inevitably fail."

The three girls started scrolling through statements, carefully reading each
word. Fera finished reading first. "Why can't we-"

"The statement text is non-negotiable," the Provost said sharply, cutting Fera off.

Kaia spoke up next. "I don't under-"

"If your families could afford attorneys, they would have paid into your
student accounts. It is not my job to explain legalese to you. I told you that
accepting the terms was going to be a huge burden on everyone!"

After going over the statement again, Kaia placed her hands on the desk and
leaned her face over the desk, signing the statement with the scans of hands
and face. A few moments later, Sata did the same. When Sata placed her hands on
the table and leaned forward, the Provost froze with his eyes open wide and
his mouth ajar as gawked at Sata. As soon as her statement was signed, Sata
jumped back into the chair curled up in a ball again. Sata and Kaia turned
their attention to Fera, who was staring at the statement with clenched fists.
When Fera noticed the other two girls looking at her, she exploded.

"This is bull-"

"Just sign it already, so we can get out of here," Sata pleaded.

Fera slammed her palms on the desk to sign the statement and leaned over the
table. Fera sat back down, but then shot back up again immediately and
proceeded to kick the desk repeatedly.

"That's real mahogany!" the Provost lamented.

"Come on, help me with Kaia," Sata said pulling Fera with one hand and
covering herself with the other hand. As soon as Sata got up from her chair,
the Provost became entranced and soon forgot about any damage that his desk
might have sustained.

Exiting the Provost's office required a team effort. With Sata trying to cover
herself, it was up to Fera to open the door. As soon as they made it past the
door, they were greeted by a familiar voice.

"Hey guys, who ordered the lesbo sandwich with butch bread?"

A group of boys started laughing and exchanging high-fives in front of the
office door. The boy had been waiting for the three girls to exit. The girls
recognized that the boy speaking to them was Dun.

"If you play your cards right, I might add some of my special sauce to your crappy
sandwich."

The boys went berserk with laughter.

"You had all that time since the ceremony and that was the best you could come
up with?" Fera fired back.

Looking over at Sata, Kaia noticed that her friend was having another seizure.
Kaia watched powerlessly as the hand that was covering Sata's chest drifted
down in the front of her.

"Look fellas, this one is ready for me," Dun said as he moved forward with his
hands reaching out towards Sata's chest. Fera swung at Dun with her free hand,
while kicking him in the shins. Kaia tried to pull Sata back away from Dun, but
was too weak to move Sata very far. Kaia opened her mouth to scream for help,
but before she could make a sound, a HistorianHummingbird crashed into the side
of Dun's face, sending him crashing to the floor.

Fera gave Dun one more kick before pulling the other two girls through the
semicircle of stunned boys. After Sata recovered, she was dazed and confused,
but she understood that they needed to run. Kaia's feet could barely keep from
dragging on the ground while the two taller girls carried her down the hallway.

"Let's head to the theater," Fera said. "It's dark inside and there are plenty
of places to hide."

Once inside the theater, the girls got up on the stage and hid behind the
curtains, trying to catch their breath. They were all tired, but still very
much on-edge. They all jumped when they noticed a set of four glowing eyes, in
the same configuration as the eyes of a brown recluse spider, staring at the
them.

A sweet voice rang out from the darkness. "Sorry to startle you. No one ever
comes to visit us. Please wait one moment while we turn on the lights. You
might want to cover your eyes until they adjust," said the sweet voice.

When the lights came on, the girls saw a boy and girl, dressed in matching
black jumpsuits. The boy seemed very awkward and reserved, while the girl
carried herself with confidence. They both had dark hair and were roughly the
same height. It was clear that they were twins.

"Welcome to the theater!" the girl proclaimed with a flourish. Placing a hand
on her chest, the girl introduced herself. "My name is Arla," then gesturing
towards her brother, "and this is Raf." Arla curtsied and the Raf bowed.

"What the hell are you?" Fera asked sharply.

"Apologies, I'm not sure what you mean," the girl replied.

"Your eyes were glowing in the dark," Sata explained.

"And you looked like a spider," Kaia added.

"I can assure you that we are not spiders," Arla said with a smile.

"Why do your eyes glow in the dark?" Fera persisted.

"I think you were seeing things. Sometimes when people are afraid of the dark,
their minds play tricks on them.", Arla replied.

"Cut the crap. We all saw it." Fera said, advancing menacingly towards the
girl. "You're Lunkers, aren't you? If you try to lie to us-"

"You mustn't tell anyone anything!" the girl exclaimed.

"It makes sense that Lunkers would want to work in a dark theater. It must
remind you of home," Sata offered.

"Explain the spider eyes," Fera said letting go of Kaia and holding up two
fingers on each hand next to her eyes.

After realizing what Fera meant, the Arla and Raf put their arms around each
other and tilted their heads together.

"We walk together like this because it enhances our night vision," the girl
explained.

"You two look really cute together," Sata said, smiling at them warmly.

"Ha, I think the night vision enhancement isn't the only reason they can't keep
their hands off of each other," Fera said laughing.

Arla and Raf separated, looking very embarrassed.

"We are brother and sister!" the boy blurted out.

Fera did not relent. "Oh, you two are naughty! Is incest normal for Lunkers?"

"Stop it, Fera," Kaia said, kicking her weakly.

Sata tried to salvage the situation by introducing herself and the other girls.

"I'm Sata, this is Kaia, and next to her is Fera. Nice to meet you both. I'd
shake your hands, but my hands are full." Sata opened her mouth to deliver the
punchline, but Fera cut her off.

"Don't say it," Fera warned.

"Do you want me to lend you a shirt from the theater?" Arla said to Sata. Sata
nodded emphatically.

Arla smiled at Sata warmly. "Come with me to the dressing room so you can try a
few things on."

Sata looked at Kaia with concern. "Kaia is hurt, do you have a place she can
rest?"

"Yeah, I would love to not have to lug this loser around anymore," Fera
added. "She's pretty heavy for such a pipsqueak."

"Yes, there is, but you mustn't tell anyone anything," Arla said.

"We get the idea," Fera said flatly, "We're not going to tell anyone anything."

Arla seemed relieved. "Ok, Raf and I built a secret bed so we could take naps
in the theater during breaks from work."

During the awkward silence that followed, Kaia saw Sata was tempted to make a
joke but held back. Unlike Sata, Fera could not resist.

"You have a secret bed? That you built yourselves? So you could sleep together?
Is that a normal thing for Lunkers?" Fera asked smiling mischievously.

Raf was so embarrassed, he started to stammer. Fera did not relent. "How long
have you been sleeping together? Is the sleep still good? Are you doing
anything to spice it up? Trying out a new pillow, maybe?"

Kaia was furious. "They're trying to help us and you keep bullying them!"

Arla tried to diffuse the situation. "We saw the recording of the ceremony
today. We think you are all very brave. We went through the rite two years
ago. It was horrible."

Raf approached Fera shyly. "I thought the gigaphone you built was great. I like
making things too."

Arla came up with a plan. "Raf, you can tell Fera and Kaia about your tinkering
on the way to the secret bed, and I'll take Sata to the dressing room."

Fera waited until Sata and Arla were out of earshot. "Have you built anything
special recently? Maybe a device to help your sister sleep? Something to knock
her out so you can knock her up!"

"Stop it!" Kaia yelled.

Fera continued to mock Raf brutally. "When you sleep together, does she snore
really loud? Do you have to cover her mouth to keep the whole college from
hearing?"

"That's enough!" Kaia yelled pushing Fera away. Not having the strength to
stand on her own, Kaia fell to her knees. Fera was not done yet. "Kaia, are you
sure you even want to lay down in the secret bed? It must be covered with sleep
stains!"

Kaia began to cry, feeling powerless to stop Fera.

"When's the last time you cleaned the sheets? Wait, have you ever cleaned the
sheets? I bet we can find the secret bed just by the smell!" Fera said,
pinching her nose with a look of disgust on her face.

Raf helped Kaia to her feet and started walking with her in the direction of
the secret bed.

Fera continued after them, not letting up even a bit. "Have you ever been this
close to a girl who wasn't your sister? Be careful, Raf, your sister might get
jealous! She's used to having you all to herself, she might not like sharing
you with Kaia." Fera continued to taunt Raf all the way to secret bed. Sata and
Arla were already there waiting for them.

"What took you so long? I was worried," Sata said. Kaia didn't respond, she
just looked angrily at Fera. Sensing the tension, Sata tried to change the
subject. "How do I look?", Sata asked. Sata twirled around and struck a
pose. She was wearing a long flowing shirt covered by an elegant bodice. The
sight of Sata took Kaia's breath away.

"Like a GuardGorilla in a milk maid outfit," Fera answered.

"What is it with you?" Kaia screamed pushing off of Raf and lunging at
Fera. Fera stepped out of the way effortlessly. Kaia stumbled and fell, landing
on her hands and knees.

"Looks like I hit a nerve! I've been making fun of Raf for ages without much of
a response. Then, I say one harmless thing about Sata and Kaia flips out. Sorry
Raf, looks like Kaia only cares about Sata, I guess you are stuck with your
sister for now."

Kaia could not hear Fera anymore over the howling wind tearing through the
theater. Sifting through the dust on the floor with her fingers, Kaia pulled
out assorted fragments of bone and shook them in her hand like dice. Through
the dust swirling around Kaia, she saw the metallic glint of the TaserTutor.
The metallic tendrils extending from TaserTutor were coiled around her arms up
to the shoulder. The ceremony was still ongoing. The TaserTutor began to pulse
red. Kaia's heart sunk. Had she imagined everything? Fera, the Provost, Dun,
Raf, Arla? Lightning shot out of the surrounding storm and coursed through
Kaia's body. Kaia screamed and writhed on the ground, but then got up with a
renewed sense of purpose.

Did she have a chance to change the future? If she answered the remaining
questions, could she turn everything around? Kaia knew what she had to do. She
would continue through the initiation rite, deny any political motivations,
blame everything on her mental illness, and do anything else necessary to keep
Sata safe, even if it meant that Fera would go to prison for years. Kaia began
to feverishly work on the problem displayed on the console.

She nearly finished with the task when the tendrils started restricting her
movements and moving up past her shoulder. The tendrils wrapped her neck and
around her head. She braced her legs against the TaserTutor and pushed as hard
as she could, trying to break free of the tendrils. New tendrils extended out
of TaserTutor wrapping around her legs. Before long, Kaia was encased head to
toe in tendrils. The tendrils constricted, wringing all of the moisture out
of her body. When the final drop of blood disappeared in the swirling dust
below, Kaia had been squeezed dry and her mummification was complete.

Roving the desolate wasteland of Mars, Kaia was the Dust Goddess, a vengeful
spirit in search of her next victim. She hunted the new invaders, the ones who
desecrated the remains of her people in search of riches. When the invaders
began to arrive with greater frequency, she raised an army of the dead to repel
them. Sitting victorious atop her throne, she waited for the next opportunity
to fertilize the barren soil of Mars with the blood of her enemies. This is was
her fate. This is how she would remain forever. In a perpetual cycle of death
and waiting, Kaia would protect the memory of her lost civilization from each
new crop of fools who sought to strike gold on the red planet.

Disturbed by an unfamiliar sensation on her forehead, the Dust Goddess let out
her anger in a roar that shook the ground. After probing her face with an
tendril-covered hand, she was stunned to see that her fingers were
moist. Without even a drop of blood in her for millennia, the Dust Goddess was
dessicated to the core. Where had the moisture come from? Tiny drops of water
were falling down on the her face wherever she went. How could there be rain on
Mars? She looked up and saw the constellations rearranging into a face that
filled the heavens. The Dust Goddess recognized the face in the stars. It was
Sata. The raindrops were coming from her eyes.

"Come back to me, please," the sky whispered. It was no use. The Dust Goddess
was not going to spring back to life from a few drops of water! The sky sighed
and began to squeeze the horizons until the land where the Dust Goddess stood
disappeared completely and the Dust Goddess was left floating in the void. The
constellations warped and stretched until they gathered into a single brilliant
ball of light. The ball of light grew arms, legs, and a head, taking the form
of Sata. Reaching her hand out to the Dust Goddess, Sata drew closer and the
tendrils began to break apart, revealing the dried out cadaver underneath.

"Kaia, I need you," Sata said.

_Yes,_ the Dust Goddess thought, _that was once my name. In a past life? Or a
future one?_

The light began to burn away her parched skin and brittle bones. Beneath it
all, a dim flicker of light began to shine. Could it still be revived? Sata
cupped her hands around the flicker and blew into it gently. Each time Sata
blew into her hands, the flicker grew stronger, eventually growing into a
flame. As Sata drew in breath, Kaia reached out from inside the flame and
gently touched the sides of Sata's face. When Sata leaned in to blow on the
flame again, Kaia pulled her in and kissed her on the lips, sucking her
life-giving breath deep into her lungs.

Kaia's body convulsed on the hard concrete floor of the theater. She was
hyperventilating, in a panic. Sata lifted Kaia's head up off the ground and
cradled it in her arms. She smoothed Kaia's hair with one hand and supported
Kaia's neck with the other. Soon the convulsions were replaced by shivers and
Kaia's eyes began to focus on Sata's face. Kaia saw Sata's face become blank as a
seizure took her. Still trembling, Kaia looked up at Sata, studying her face
intently, waiting for Sata to come back. When Sata returned and saw Kaia
looking up at her, tears sprung anew from Sata's eyes and bathed Kaia's face.

"Is she alive?" Fera asked impatiently.

"Yes, no thanks to you," Sata replied sharply.

"Let's get her into bed," Arla said.

Kaia was underwater in a sea of tears, looking up at Sata in the stars above.
An eight-eyed octopus obscured the view of the sky and Kaia tried to shoo it
away, but it extended four pairs of tentacles towards Kaia and carried her with
to onto a tuft of seaweed. Kaia suddenly felt very grateful to the octopus. She
gazed deeply into as many of its eyes as could. Reaching out her hands, she
began to caress its tentacles. The tentacles began to reciprocate. Kaia was
blissfully exchanging caresses with the octopus when she had a startling
thought. "If I'm underwater, how is it that I'm breathing?" Kaia shot up,
throwing the tentacles off of her and gasping for air.

"It's OK, Kaia," Sata said reassuringly. "You're safe now."

Sata laid down next to Kaia in the bed, cradling Kaia in her arms. Kaia buried
her face in Sata's shirt just above the bodice. The smell of the starchy shirt
mixing with Sata's scent was heavenly. Soon, Kaia stopped trembling and her
body relaxed. Kaia lifted her face up to look at Sata. Sata was so radiant and
lovely that Kaia began to cry.

Sata leaned in and kissed Kaia's cheeks, catching the fresh tears with her
lips. Kaia fell asleep with a smile on her face as Sata slowly showered her
with kisses. The blissful look on Kaia's face warmed Sata's heart. They were
together. They were safe, at least for now. The world melted away. Sata did not
realize how exhausted she was until now. With one arm still around Kaia, Sata
tugged futilely at the bindings of her bodice.

"Let me help you," Arla said as she swooped in to deftly undo the bindings of
the bodice and pull it out from under Sata. This kind gesture surprised Sata so
much that she began to cry. Through the tears, Sata looked at Arla with
gratitude.

"Don't cry," Arla said, unfastening and removing Sata's heels and then pulling
up the blankets to cover Kaia and Sata, "You're safe here and I'll stay and
watch over you."

Unable to recall anyone other than Kaia being kind to her, Sata let out a sob.
Afraid she had said something wrong, Arla stepped backwards. "I'm going to turn
off the lights."

As the theater descended into darkness, Sata snuggled up to Kaia, greedily
interlacing their legs and pulling Kaia closer with her arms. Recalling how
Kaia often breathed in deep when they hugged, Sata rested her nose on top of
Kaia's head and filled her lungs with the scent of Kaia's hair. The darkness
around Sata exploded with a kaleidoscope of shimmering colors. With another
breath, Sata began to float in between the colors as they gently twinkled
around her. By the third breath, Sata was in another plane of existence
entirely, slowly drifting off to sleep in the arms of her lifelong best friend.
