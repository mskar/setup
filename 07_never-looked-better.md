## Chapter 6: Never looked better

"What is this Lord-Of-The-Rings, deus-ex-machina nonsense?", Fera screamed.

"Are you upset that you did not die?", Raf asked confused.

"No, but being saved by a giant bird is weird, and I don't like dangling in air
from razor sharp talons. How do I know that this dumb bird won't drop me?" Fera
said feeling powerless. Her gloves and skates were useless in the air.

Fera remembered that Ben said that all the equipment from the maker workshop
had trackers. Fera hastily removed her gloves and skates, dropping them into
the city below, and watching as they disappeared into the growing sea of fire
below. The heat from the explosion lifted them up higher.

"Why did you save me?" Fera asked Raf.

"I didn't save you. The birds did."

"But you control the birds, right?"

"You mustn't tell anyone anything!"

"Why didn't you leave me behind?"

"Based on my observations of you, I am convinced that you do not wish to do me
any harm and perhaps may even by fond of me."

"What the hell are you taking about?"

"When we were on the motorcycle, were you concerned about my well being?

"Don't flatter yourself."

"You touched my hair very gently."

"You were unconscious. You were probably just dreaming."

"I feel like it is my turn to tease you."

"What?"

"You obviously feel affection towards me, but you do not want to admit it."

"When we land, I will show you some affection with my foot. I'm going to
tender, love, and care your face until there's nothing left," Fera screamed
swinging at arms and legs at Raf in a futile gesture of aggression.

"Please Fera, you're upsetting the birds. I do not believe you anyway. You are
using deception to hide your feelings, because you are afraid of getting hurt.
Do not worry. I am fond of you as well, and I will do anything I can to protect
you and make you happy."

"The only thing that will make me happy is stomping on your face."

"I will be glad to oblige. There is not much left of my face anyway."

"You've never looked better. I'm going to make some more improvements when we
land."

"I am looking forward to it."

"Where are we flying anyway?"

"The entrance to the Lunker capital."

"What?! No!" Fera had never been outside of the city. The thought of going
anywhere else, especially a place filled with Lunkers, did not seem very
appealing.

"You do not have much of a choice in the matter," Raf said gesturing towards
the eagles. "After destroying the city, you may want to lay low for a while."

The eagles set Fera, Raf, and the Principal down on top of a hill surrounded by
red brick ruins near the edge of the forest. Raf pointed into the forest. "The
entrance is hidden in the forest. We have to walk the rest of the way."

"Wait, what is this place?" Fera asked.

"This is Kosciuszko Mound in the Wolski Forest. The ancient city there was
called Kraków in Ancient Latin, Ancient Spanish, and Ancient Italian."

"What should we do with him?" Fera asked gesturing towards the Principal, who
was lying on the ground next to them. His shirt and blazer were covered in
vomit. "He doesn't look like he can walk and I wouldn't carry him even if I
could."

"I will call for help," Raf said closing his eyes.

"No more birds!" Fera yelled.

"Ok, no more birds," Raf agreed.

"What should I do?"

"Enjoy the view."

Fera spotted an airship in the distance. Fera was unsure about whether she
should tell Raf. She watched as it moved lazily across the sky. Why was it
going so slow? Was it going in circles?

"That airship will not be able to help us," Raf said calmly, his eyes
still closed.

"How do you know?"

"A little birdie told me."

"Very funny."

"Their engines stopped working. They've been circling for hours. They are going
to crash. We could wait for them to crash and then explore the wreckage for
survivors."

Fera thought about it. There might not be any survivors, but if there were,
they might blame Fera for the crash. If Fera had not destroyed the city, they
would not have been on the airship. Fera made up her mind quickly. "I don't
want to wait."

Raf opened his eyes. "Look there," he said pointing to the bottom of the hill,
where three stags stood waiting.

"Is that our ride?" Fera asked. Raf nodded.

"Why don't you have them come here?"

"They don't want to climb up the hill just to carry us down."

"Are we supposed to carry the Principal down?"

"We can roll him down," Raf suggested. Fera liked that idea, perhaps a little
too much. She gave the Principal a heave followed by a few kicks to keep him
going. Raf and Fera chased the Principal as he picked up speed going down the
hill. Fera laughed as she watched the Principal tumbled down the hill.
Raf stared at Fera as she ran barefoot down the hill. She was a Valkyrie taking
delight in serving justice.

When they got to the bottom of the hill, Fera wished she could roll the
Principal down again. The stags knelt down and Fera helped Raf put the
Principal on the back of the nearest stag. Fera had never ridden an animal, not
even a robotic one. The prospect of riding a real live stag was terrifying.

"Can the other stags kneel down for us too?"

"Watch." Raf ran up to one of the stags, grabbed onto its antlers, and swung
himself up onto its back.

Fera copied Raf, but did not pick up enough speed and slid down the side of her
stag. The stag looked away from Fera as if embarrassed by her failure. Fera
kept holding on the stag's antlers, terrified that the stag could impale her
with just a flick of its head. The stag brought its head back around and Fera
closed her eyes, expecting to be skewered. Flying through the air, Fera
realized the stag was swinging her onto its back. When Fera landed, she made
eye contact with one the stag's eyes. It waited for Fera to let go of its
antlers before turning its head back around.

The three stags walked through the ruins and then entered the forest, as if
they knew exactly where to go. Fera held onto the antlers of her stag for dear
life. Raf was looking at her intently.

"Why are you looking at me like that?"

"Is this a good time to talk about our mutual affection?"

"Do you enjoy getting kicked?"

"I do not, but ever since I understood that you express your emotions through
violence, I feel strangely content when you kick me."

"You get off on me kicking you?"

"I would prefer that you show your affection for me some other way."

"I think kicks are the only kind of affection you're going to get from me."

"I will be happy to receive any kind of affection from you I can."

"Why do you like me?" Fera asked after a long pause.

Raf looked at her intensely. "You are the most amazing person I have ever met."

Fera was shocked. "All I do is make fun of you and kick you."

"When I look at you, I can feel your pain. I am not angry at you for hurting
me. Actually, it's quite the opposite. I want you to kick me, as long as it
helps you. Whenever you need a face to kick, I will be happy to offer mine."

Fera could tell that Raf was being absolutely serious. He looked sad and
compassionate, but hopeful. Raf smiled at Fera. "Talking with you feels really
nice. This moment is worth all of the kicks you gave me."

Fera looked away. She riding a stag through the woods next to a crazy person.
She decided to change the subject. "How much farther?"

"We are taking a detour to get help for the Principal. He is going to go into
withdrawal, if he hasn't already."

"Who are we getting help from? More of your animals?"

"This time we need help from the people of this forest. They call
themselves the Driads."

"People live in this forest?"

"They keep their presence hidden from other topsiders. They feel more
comfortable around Lunkers than city dwellers. Let me do the talking.
I think I can convince them to help us."

"Ok, let me know when we are close."

"Oh, we are already close."

"What?"

"They have been following us and studying us since we entered the forest."

Fera looked around, but could not see anyone. She was about to ask Raf if he
was joking, when arrows shot down from the trees above and landed in front of
them. The stags reared up on their hindlegs. Fera was able to hold on, but the
Principal tumbled down off of his stag.

Raf hopped of his stag and raised his arms, showing his palms. "We need your
help!"

"Raf, maybe you can show them how you can grow roots and photosynthesize?"

"You mustn't tell anyone anything!" Raf said forcefully.

A small elderly woman rappelled down from a tree. "We are Driads. We
speak for the trees. You are trespassing in our forest."

"Greetings, I am Raf, and this is Fera. Our companion is sick from exposure to
narcotics. He may die without your help."

"Greetings, Raf and Fera. I am Arba. How is it that you know this forest?"

"I do not know this forest, but these stags do."

"How is it that you can command the stags? And the birds that brought you
here?"

"I am a mimic."

"A mimic? We know of your kind. That means that these stags are mimics
too and not real animals. It will be no great loss if we kill you and use
you as fertilizer."

"Please, one of my companions is a brave warrior who destroyed the nearby
city of Katovicen."

"A warrior you say? We saw the smoke above Katovicen from the treetops. Allow
me to take a look at this warrior," Arba said walking up to the Principal.

"He does not appear to be much of a warrior," Arba said, disappointedly poking
the Principal with her toe.

"The warrior who destroyed the city is me," Fera huffed.

"You?" Arba said, turning to face Fera. "A little girl? How did a child
such as you destroy a whole city?"

"It is true, she activated the self-destruct sequence of our school, knowing it
would cause a chain reaction that would destroy the whole city."

Fera had not known about the chain reaction, but she decided to pretend that
she had known.

"Why did you destroy the city?" Arba asked leaning towards Fera.

"The government oppresses anyone who doesn't have power. I blew up the city as
part of the revolution that will overthrow the government and usher in a new
era of freedom and equality."

"Your words do not sound hollow. If you promise to respect and protect the
forest. We will aid you."

After Raf and Fera promised, other Driads rappelled down from trees.
Still more, came out of hiding from behind other trees, bringing various items
and placing them down on the ground in front of Fera and Raf. Fera looked over
the items. There were leaves covered berries, nut, and insects, gourds filled
with water, clothes made of animal skins, knives, bows, and quivers of arrows.

"While we tend to your companion, you may eat and rest. We would be honored if
the city destroyer and her mimic companion could wear our clothing and use our
weapons on their quest to overthrow the government," Arba said as several
Driads carried the Principal away on a wooden sled.

Fera eyed the food with suspension. Raf seemed to have no problem with the food
and ate bugs, nuts, and berries heartily. Fera picked a knife and unsheathed
it. She was disappointed to see that knives it was entirely made out of wood.
When she tried the edge of the knife, she was surprised that it was quite
sharp.

"The knives and arrows are lignum vitae wood. They cannot break steel, but they
can cut flesh," Arba explained.

Fera put the shoes that the Driads brought her. The shoes, moccasins
made out of animal skin, were very comfortable. She went behind a tree to
change into the rest of the clothes. When she came back Raf had already
changed.

"Not the modest type I see. You might even be an exhibitionist. Do you get off
on showing everyone your dangling parts?"

Raf was silent.

"You're probably excited that you can finally undress in front of someone other
than your sister."

"Why do mimic men like to undress in front of others?" Arba asked,
sitting down in front of Fera and Raf.

Raf blushed and Fera laughed. "It may not be all mimic men, but this one
certainly does."

Arba furrowed her brow in thought. "We only know of mimics from our
legends."

"What do your legends say, Arba?" Fera asked, sitting down as Arba had done.

"That mimics can look and act just like humans, but some mimics look and act
like animals, and that mimics can communicate with each other without
speaking."

Fera raised her eyebrows at Raf. "That's how you controlled the birds and
stags, with telepathy?"

Raf nodded.

Fera turned back to Arba. "Other than the animal mind control,
what else makes mimics different?"

"Mimics grow until maturity and then age no more. They can live and bear offspring
forever, but mimics reproduce differently from us. For example, we know that a
mimic man cannot get a human woman pregnant, but can himself become pregnant,
even without intercourse."

Fera's eyes lit up at the prospect of new ways to tease Raf. "So the downside
is that you are shooting blanks, but the upside is that you are capable of
immaculate conception?"

Raf nodded again. Fera was eager to learn more. "What about mimic women?"

"Mimic women can be pregnant without intercourse as well," Arba explained.

"And that's it?" Fera asked, a bit disappointed.

"Mimic women are harder to identify than mimic men," Arba explained.

"Are there no other ways to tell who is a mimic?" Fera asked.

"If a mimic is starved, they can survive by becoming like plants," Arba said.

Fera looked at Raf in amazement. "You weren't kidding when you said you could
photosynthesize!"

"Yes, but you mustn't tell anyone anything! I believe the Driad mean us
no harm, but other topsiders might want to capture and study mimics."

"Where do mimics come from?" Fera asked.

"The stars," Arba said.

"You're an alien?" Fera asked.

Raf nodded.

"Are you here to invade Earth?" Fera asked.

"I don't know. We came to Earth as messages from distant worlds. Humans decoded
the messages and built the first mimics according to the encoded instructions.
Since then we have been learning to peacefully co-exist with humans."

"Why do your people live in the forest?"

"It is the same reason why Lunkers hid below the ground and Subaks hid beneath
the waves. A long time, there was a great war fought with terrible weapons.
Light beams would come down from the sky to burn those who walked in the open.
Our Ancestors survived by hiding in the forest."

"It's safe to be out in the open now."

"We know. We believe that the light beams were sent from the heavens to show us
that living among the trees is the best way for our people."

"How is that we speak the same language and you seem to know everything about
us?"

"The young of our people go through a rite of passage by living in a city. By
going through the rite, our young can learn about city life and why living
among the trees is better. I went through the rite many years ago. I am glad
that you destroyed the city."

"But what about the rite of passage? Can your young go to Kraków instead of
Katovicen?"

Arba shook her head. "Anyone who enters Kraków does not return."

"The World Heritage Site robots kill anyone inside the city," Raf explained.

"Is there another city nearby?

"None like Katovicen. On the other side of Kraków, there is a city of tents.
The airships from Katovicen are heading there."

"Do you want to go there instead of the Lunker city?" Raf asked. Fera shrugged.
She was not sure if she was a fugitive. It might be smarter to go to the
Lunker city until she found out for sure.

"Your companion is very sick. It may be many
days before he is well enough to travel. In the meantime, we can teach you out
ways," Arba offered.

"I would like to learn to hunt," Fera admitted.

"We do not hunt."

"If you don't hunt, where do you get the animal skins for your clothes?"

"We look for dead animals in the forest and skin them."

Fera looked her clothes and was tempted to smell them. "Do you ever hunt
animals? For meat?"

"No, we do not hunt. We get more than enough food from the forest."

"Do you fish?"

"How is hunting fish different from hunting other animals? Do you not like our
food? Your stags seem to be enjoying it."

Fera looked at the food in front of her. Some of the bugs were crawling off of
the leaves and onto the grass. She quickly ate some nuts and berries, carefully
avoiding the bugs and crunching loudly while complimenting how delicious the
food tasted.

"Well, we do not want to delay our quest to overthrow the government, so
perhaps we can leave our sick companion with you until he gets better."

"Yes, of course, you may leave him, but you should not travel at night. Stay
one night. You may leave at first light."

Fera nodded. Riding a stag through a dark forest did not seem like a great
idea. The Driads laid down pieces of moss-covered bark onto the ground.
Arba got up and gestured towards the bark. "You may sleep here. We will return
at sunrise to bid you farewell on your quest. Good night."

Fera walked up to the spot Arba had indicated. "What do you think, Raf? Will it
be as comfortable as your secret bed?"

Raf sat down on the bark bed opposite Fera. Fera pulled out a wooden knife.
"Just don't try anything, I'm not your sister."
Raf curled up into ball facing away from Fera. Fera tried to smooth things over.
"At least I don't have to worry about you getting me pregnant, right?"

"Yes, mimics cannot get humans pregnant."

"But you can become pregnant? At any moment? Is it random?"

"No, it is not random. I would have to develop a deep emotional connection with
someone for a long period of time."

"You get pregnant from emotions?! Am I getting you pregnant right now just by
talking with you?" Fera said excitedly.

Raf looked back at Fera, his eyes filled with tears. "I would be the luckiest
mimic on Earth if I could bear children for you. I feel like I could be with
you forever and it wouldn't be enough."

Fera was stunned, but then broke out laughing. "Did you just propose to me?"

"Mimics do not view marriage the same was as humans. You do not need to
dedicate yourself to me. I would only ask that you allow me to dedicate myself
to you and be near you always."

"So you would just follow me around popping out kids forever?"

"Yes, but each the pregnancy takes nine months and is risky. Mimics can live
indefinitely, but many die from complications during pregnancy or during
childbirth."

"Are you pregnant right now?"

"No, but my body is already preparing for pregnancy. The process is not
automatic, because a pregnant mimic can die from sorrow if they are separated
from their loved one for too long."

"So if you get pregnant and I ditch you, you could die."

"Yes, but first I would need to be convinced that there might be a chance for
you to allow me to stay near you."

"When you have a baby? Is it just a clone of you?"

"No, mimic bodies collect the genetic material of our loved ones and mix the
collected genetic material with our own to create a viable offspring. Unlike in
human reproduction, the genetic material itself is insufficient to create a
viable offspring. The offspring are engineered based on the information
collected during interactions with loved ones."

"Wow, I am not sure how you did it, but you succeeded in making sexual
reproduction sound really boring."

"Sex is not required for mimic reproduction."

Fera thought for a while. "Will you let me know before you get pregnant?"

"Of course, I would never do it without your consent."

Satisfied with Raf's answers, Fera laid down on the bark bed next to him.
Looking up at the stars through the trees, Fera thought for a long time about
her next question. "When you lived with the Lunkers, did they know you were a
mimic?"

"No, my mother choose not to tell anyone that she was a mimic. She told Arla
and me to keep it a secret. My father never knew."

"Did your parents die in the gas attack?"

"Yes. You are lucky to still have your parents."

"I miss my mom. I hope she got out of the city in time, but I wouldn't be upset
if my dad died in the explosion."

"I am sorry that he hurt you," Raf said quietly. Fera was angry that Raf
brought it up, but she felt a lot less anger than she expected. She considered
stabbing Raf with her wooden knife, but decided against it. Instead, Fera kept
her mind busy by counting all the ways she could torture and brutally kill Raf
the next day. Fera fell asleep with violence on her mind. She dreamed of
stringing up those who had wronged her, slicing them open with her wooden
knives, and dancing beneath the shower of their blood.

Fera awoke shivering. It was still dark and the moisture from the moss beneath
her had permeated through her animal skin clothes. She had never felt so cold
in her life. She noticed that Raf was sleeping soundly without shivering at
all. Fera shifted towards Raf hoping to warm up a little.

"Are you cold?" Raf asked.

"Yes, aren't you?"

"Mimics do not need as much heat as humans. If you like, I can warm you up."

"Fine, but don't get any funny ideas or I'll carve you open and sleep inside
your entrails for warmth."

Raf put his arms around Fera. He started to vibrate and emanate a surprising
amount of heat. "How are you doing that?" Fera asked.

"Producing heat? The same way you do, by contracting my muscles and releasing
energy stored in glycogen. I have a lot of energy saved from being out in the
sun and from the food the Driads gave us. You should have eaten
more. Would you like me to bring you some of the food now?"

"Just shut up and be warm," Fera turning around and pressing her back against
Raf. His body conformed around her and Fera soon stopped shivering. She felt
safe. She was glad to be alive. Raf had saved her. Fera would never admit it,
but she felt grateful.

This time when Fera went to sleep she was thinking happy thoughts. She dreamed
she was holding a child in her arms. The child looked up at her. Fera
recognized herself in the child's face. Raf had given Fera the gift of life a
second time. Surrounded by warmth and love, Fera began to cry tears of joy.

When Fera woke up in morning, her child was gone. Fera looked around in a
panic, but then she remembered that she did not have a child. Her stirring woke
up Raf. "Fera are you alright?"

"Yes, I'm fine. Even though I couldn't sleep much with you poking at me all
night."

Raf blushed and moved away. "That's a normal reaction that human males have. To
become better adapted to living among humans, mimic males have evolved to
exhibit the same response."

Fera laughed. She enjoyed tormenting Raf and he made it so easy for her. Fera
stood up fastened a belt with two sheathed knives to her waist and slung a
quiver of wooden arrows, a bow, and a water gourd over her shoulder.

"Come on, lover boy, you promised you would show me around the Lunker capital."

Raf stood up, but then turned away from Fera. Fera laughed again. "You're such
a prude! You said it was normal. As natural as rainbows! There's no need to
hide it!"

Raf grabbed two water gourds and a quiver of arrows, then mounted his stag in
hurry. Fera threw a bow towards Raf. "You forgot this. The arrows won't be much good
without it."

The Driads had begun to gather around. Fera saw Arba and waved to her.

"Farewell city destroyer. We will tend to your companion. If you ever need
assistance, come to this forest. We will teach our children to sing songs of
your bravery, glory, and honor."

Fera bowed to Arba, ran up to her stag, swung up by its antlers onto its back. This
time the motion was much more fluid and Fera noted the impression it made on
the Driads.

Once they were out of earshot, Fera looked at Raf, "Is the Principal going to
be ok with them?".

"Yes, he will have the best care possible. Fresh air, clean water, natural
food, and most importantly no buzzBees."

I was not long before they arrived at a cave. Fera was upset to see that the
cave was not from the Kosciuszko mound. "We were right next to it when we landed!"

"Yes, but we have to help the Principal first," Raf said as he dismounted and
walked towards the cave.

"I'm not going to be able to see in there, am I?"

"I'll gather enough bioluminescent algae for you to see. When we get to the
city, there will be electric lights. We can ask around. Maybe we can find out
where the airships were headed."

Fera follow Raf into the cave and watched him scrap algae off the walls. He
triumphantly showed her the handful of algae he had collected. Fera could see
Raf's hand and his glowing eyes, but not much else. Raf held out the algae with
one hand and pulled Fera forward with the other. Fera had no idea where they
were going. Even after her eyes adjusted to darkness, she could only see Raf's
outline illuminated by the algae in his hand.

Fera breathed a sigh of relief when they entered a tunnel with electric lights.
As they approached the entrance to the city, a young Lunker run up to them.
"Congratulations, you've won a free, all-expenses-paid trip to Wieliczka salt
mine, including a free boat ride on Lake Wessel, for two people!

"Excuse us, we need to discuss." Fera said, drawing Raf into a huddle.

"Don't you think it is suspicious that it's a free tip and boat ride
specifically for two people? There are exactly two of us. It seems a little on
the nose."

"We shouldn't look a gift horse in the mouth," Raf said. "That lake is an
important part of the cultural heritage of Lunkers. I have always wanted to see
it," Raf said.

"It's a trap and I am going to say no and if you try to stop me I'll stab you."

"Please Fera, let me talk to him, Lunker to Lunker. If it is a trap, I will
find out."

"Ok, go ahead, you have one minute."

Raf walked up to his fellow Lunker with a smile and started to talk with him in
a quiet, friendly voice.

"What's your name?"

"Nil."

"Greetings Nil! I am Raf and this is Fera." The conversation seemed to be going
well until a rock hit the Lunker in the side of the head with such force that
he crumpled to the floor. Fera pounced on Lunker's chest with a rock in each
hand and started to make a few improvements to his face.

Raf looked on in horror. He wanted to stop Fera, but both felt that it was
better that Fera stayed focused on Nil rather than on him. Once Fera was
satisfied with the facial remodeling, leaned in close to the Nil's face and
said "Who sent you?", in the lowest voice she could. Unfortunately, Nil was
very unconscious and unable to answer her question.

"Lunkers are useless. Let's get out of here."

Raf quickly followed Fera, afraid that if he did not, then he might be next.
Before long, another Lunker approached them, as before.

"Congratulations, you've won a free, all-expenses-paid trip to the Wieliczka
salt mine and a free boat ride on Lake Wessel for any number of people!"

Fera laughed, thinking it was a joke, then realized that the Lunker was
absolutely serious, and picked up a fresh pair of rocks.

"Who sent you?" Fera asked, raising one of the rocks.

"Please don't hurt me. I'll tell you everything."

"Why don't you start with your name," Raf said trying to diffuse the situation.

"Oil."

"Your name is Oil?" Fera asked.

"My parents are trying to break the world record for most number of children
produced by a monogamous couple. They thought it would get confusing with so
many children so they created a system. The first letter of the first name of
each subsequent child is next letter of the alphabet."

Fera thought for a little while.

"You have 14 older siblings?"

"Actually, my parents don't keep track of our ages, so I am not sure what the
temporal order might be. All I know is that I am their 15th son and my sister
Nila is their 15th daughter."

"Nila was my mother's name!" Raf shouted.

Fera remembered that Kaia's waipo's name (mother's mother's name) was Aila.
Perhaps Lunkers were not that different from topsiders?

"Do you have an older brother named Nil by any chance?"

"Yes, of course I do! He was very excited this morning, because he got a big
job that he said would pay a lot of money. He said we would never go hungry
again! Then, I got this job, which also has a big payout. And all I have to do
is to take you to the lake and get you on the boat!"

...
""

"What happened to Nil?"

"He fell on his face. Repeatedly. So clumsy. He really should learn to be more
careful." Fera saw the two bloody rocks she had dropped earlier and hastily
kicked them away.

When Nil regained consciousness, he saw Fera and shrunk back in fear.

"Wakey, Wakey, Nil. After you fell down on your face repeatedly, we went to go
get help and ran into your brother Oil."

"I fell on my face?" Nil asked, surprised.

"Yes.", Fera emphasized, "Repeatedly. You're quite clumsy. You should really
learn to be more careful."

"Nil has never fallen down before..."

"Well, there's a first time for everything. We'll let you take us to your
stupid lake, but if you slow us down, we're going to leave you behind and go
ourselves."

Nil was on his feet in a flash. "No, if you go yourselves, we will not get
paid."

"Well, then you better not slow us down."

...

"Why is this place called Wieliczka?"

"This mine has been called many things over the years. Magnus Sal, from ancient Latin, and Gross Salce, from ancient German.

"Magnus Sal? Meaning great salt?"

"Yes, the translation of Magnus Sal into Ancient Polish, Wielka Sól, is the supposed origin of the name Wieliczka.

"These tunnels were carved by ancient miners."

"What were they mining?"

"Salt."

"What?! They couldn't desalinate sea water?"

"I guess not. The mine was a huge source of wealth. Salt was the main method to
keep food from spoiling."

"They did not have refrigerators? Or synthesizers to make their food?"

"I guess not. My understanding is that they had no electronics at all."

"How did they survive?"


"This is the part of the tunnel where the salt concentration is the highest.
You can taste the salt by licking any of the walls, but this part of the tunnel
is extra salty."

Raf leaned in towards the wall, sticking out his tongue.

"Raf, what are you doing?!"

"Tasting the salt." he said sheepishly.

"Do you know how many people have licked these walls before you?"

"No one knows for sure, but millions of people visit the salt mine every year
and the Licking Ring is very popular, because of its purported health benefits."

"This whole tunnel is filled with germs."

"Actually, the only microorganisms that can survive on the walls are halophilic
bacteria. The halophiles are one possible explanation for the health benefits
that many visitors report."

"No one is licking the walls." Fera said definitely. "Let's keep moving."

Nil describes the carvings in the walls and 

difficult to remember " They travel by underground train.
hyperloop. vacuum tunnel.

Raf wants to impress her with Lunker technology and culture.
He offers to take her to an archaeology dig.

The door to the ancient structure opens when Fera approaches.

The AI inside greets Fera and explains that it observed Fera in the school and
was very impressed.

Even though Fera replaced all of the footage of her with deep fakes, the AI saved
copies before they were replaced.

The Lunkers lost the ancient war between Dextrae and Sinistrae.
The Sinistrae retreated to the hidden capsules.
The AI is based on a system called UNO, while other AIs are based on DOS.
The AI has been sabotaging DOS systems since the war ended for fun.
No one has noticed because DOS systems are innately terrible.

The AI offers Fera a choice to become the figurehead of the next revolution or
continue in her current state.

The drawback is that outside technology would cease to work for her, but
anything inside the capsule would work for her. Also, Dextrae AIs would try to
kill her so she needed to stay underground until they could destroy the satellites.

She notices that it makes Raf sick, but does not affect the Principal.

Fera accepts and begins organizing the revolution.

The Principal becomes her administrative assistant. Raf helps out by spreading
the word to all Lunkers. He cannot help inside the capsule because he has to stay
outside the capsule because it makes him sick.

The chapter ends with Fera, Naksos (Mel), and Raf sleeping on the train on their way
to the refugee camp.

...

Fera and Raf go to the Driads to ask for help with Mel. They spend the
night. Fera feels very cold. The Driad do not use fire. She did not eat
much of the food and now is hungry. Raf hugs her to keep her warm. Fera
complains but secretly enjoys physical contact with Raf. They arrive at the
Lunker city. They meet Nil and Oil. Fera thinks the boat ride is a trap, but
decides to go anyway. Nil and Oil act as tour guides. Fera enjoys the boat ride
with Raf, even though she does not want to admit it. The boat is pulled between
the two sides of the lake by a rope. The water level drops until the boat is on
the bottom of a ravine. A door opens. The air that rushes out seems to make Raf
sick. His body abandons preparation for pregnancy causing him to bleed from his
crotch. His skin turned pitch black, his feet sprouted roots and membranes out
under his arm and in between his legs and fingers. Fera drags Raf away, but
feels powerless to help him. Fera looked up. Climbing out of the pit would take
a long time. She decided to go through the door. Whatever made Raf sick came
from inside there. Maybe there was some clue inside? Fera took a deep breath
and drew an arrow. Holding her bow up with nocked arrow at ready, Fera passed
through the door.

...

Once inside, Fera encounters the AI. The AI explains Sinistrae and introduces
Fera to Eiva. Eiva vomits out the stasis liquid and goes through a wash cycle
like in Austin Powers. Eiva and Fera immediately hit it off. "Why do you talk
so weird?" "I did not learn your language naturally. The AI remodeled the
language center of my brain while I was in stasis. I have a terrible headache
and I hate how stupid your language sounds. I don't care if it sounds weird to
you. The only thing that matters is that you can understand me." "I like the
way you sound. It's different, but I like it." The AI asks Eiva if Fera is an
acceptable candidate. Eiva says that Fera's abilities were demonstrated when
she blew up the city, but she wants to test Fera herself. Eiva hands a pair of
bone knives to Fera and tells her to defend herself. Fera is amazed at how fast
Eiva is able to move. Eiva says that she feels like she is moving through
molasses after being in stasis for so long. "What's molasses?" "Stop it, you're
making me feel old." "You look pretty good for your age." Fera realizes that
Eiva is aiming for her knife. "You're holding back." "Stop talking and fight."
Fera throws both of her bone knives at Eiva and rushes Eiva with the wooden
knives she has at her belt. Eiva deflect the thrown knives easily, but her feet
slid on the dust on the floor. Eiva laughed. "You almost ran into my knives.
Were you trying to get stabbed?" "I knew you were holding back and not at your
best. You might have been able to stab me but I have two knives to your throat.
Did I pass your little test?" "Yeah, you can get off me now." "What's the rush?
I kinda like being on top of you." "Drop those the knives and we'll see how
long you stay on top." Eiva said tossing her knives away. Fera did the same and
looked at Eiva defiantly. "Bring it!" Eiva grabbed Fera's shirt, bridged, and
rolled Fera off her with ease. Fera landed on her back and looked up at Eiva
with admiration. "The view from the bottom is not bad either." Eiva laughed.
"Can you teach me how to do that?" "Only if you dedicate yourself to leading
the resurgence." "Why can't you lead?" "I know nothing about your time. My
mission is prepare you to lead and then follow you." "So, you'll have to do
anything I say." Fera asked putting her hands on Eiva's hips. Eiva laughed. She
looked annoyed but did not move Fera's hands. "You'll have to earn the right to
lead. I can train you, but once we start, you can't back out. If you try to go
back to how your life was before, I'll have to kill you to preserve our
secrets." Eiva said gripping Fera's shirt menacingly.

"So you want me to overthrow the government? What are you going to put in its place?"

"That's up to you. I know nothing of your time."

"So after you train me, I get to call the shots."

"Yes, you'll be in charge as long as you don't do anything to betray the cause."

"All of this seems too good to be true. How do I know you are not trying to trick me?"

"How do you feel?"

"I feel good, but maybe its just that I like having you on top of me."

Eiva laughed, got up off Fera, and helped her up. "Does it feel like this was
meant to be? The AI selected you to lead the resurgence. You're the first
candidate ever, after thousands of years. If you don't want to lead, you can go
back to your life as it was and I'll go back to stasis. Is that what you want?"

"No," Fera said.

"Are you sure?" Eiva leaned in.

"Yes, I am."

"That's a relief. I'm glad you passed the test. If you hadn't agreed to lead, I
would've had to kill you and try to figure out your world on my own."

"You said I could back to my life."

"The first lesson in your training is 'Don't believe everything you hear'. From
the moment you found the capsule, you knew too much to go back to your previous
life."

"The first lesson is that I shouldn't trust anyone?"

"No, think about what people are saying. Does it makes sense for me to just let
you go and hop back in the stasis pod? Now that you found the capsule, others
can too. If I let you go, you could lead them here. If I were in stasis, I
would be defenseless. We have only one chance to bring about the resurgence and
this is it."

"One chance is all we'll need," Fera said narrowing her eyes and raising a
clenched fist.

"Good, the first mission is reconnaissance. Do you have any allies that could
help us with the resurgence?"

"Allies?" Fera realized she forgot about Raf. "There's Raf. He's outside. He's
sick."

"He got sick as soon as you opened the door?"
Fera nodded.

"His body must be dependent on Dextrae for survival."

"What?"

"I'll explain once we help him. Come on."

Eiva grabbed Fera by the hand and lead her to cabinet.

"Before we go, we need equipment. These are skinScabbards. Put they go on your
forearms and shins."

"Are these made of skin?"

"Yes, they have bone knives inside. There's a flap by the hilt of each knife.
You'll have 8 knives on each forearm and 12 knives on each leg."

"40 knives?! Do think that will be enough?"

"We can always make more bone knives from fallen comrades and enemies."

Fera laughed but then realized that Eiva was not joking.

When they got outside.

"Don't touch him. Don't even go near him. Tell him to get in the boat."

"What? Why?"

"If you get near him, he will get worse. Unia will refill the lake. Then we can pull him in with the rope."

"So we're not getting in the boat with Raf?"

"No, being near us could kill him. Tell him to get in the boat. If he doesn't, he's going to die."

"Raf, can you hear me?"

Raf moaned. His eyes were half closed.

"Raf, you need to go back to the boat."

"Maybe we should leave him. He doesn't look like he would be a useful comrade anyway."

"He can be useful. He saved my life."

"Does he float? Maybe he doesn't need to be in the boat?"

"Raf, listen to me. If you die here, Arla will left all alone."

Raf's eyes opened wider.

"If you don't make it out of here, your parents will have died for nothing."

Raf sobbed and rolled over on his stomach, ripping out the roots that connected
his feet with the ground.

"If you don't get on that boat, I'm going to find Arla and tell her that you
gave up on her. She'll know that your parents' sacrifice didn't mean anything
to you."

Raf started crawling, but stopped and threw up onto the ground in front of him.

"If you don't keep moving, I swear I'll kill her, Raf! I'll tell her you gave
up and then she's going to die knowing that you didn't care enough about her to try."

Raf crawled through his own vomit up to the boat.

"If you don't get in that boat, she's as good as dead, Raf. You know I'll do
it. You know me. I won't hesitate. I'll enjoy it."

Raf brought himself up just barely enough to roll into the boat and hit the
floor like a bag of potatoes.

Eiva started to clap. "Well done. You knew exactly what to say to motivate him.
Looks like we picked the right person to lead the resurgence. Now let's start
climbing or we're going to get wet."

...

"I will transfer command to you after you can best me in
grappling, archery, and knife combat." "I already beat you in knife combat."
Eiva laughed again. "Your training hasn't even started yet." "When do we
start?" "First, we need to do some." Fera forgets about Raf.
Fera and Eiva climb out using the rope connected to the boat then use the rope
to lift Raf out. Fera is suprised that she can climb so well. She thinks Raf is
extremely light, but the truth is she has become extremely strong. The AI
closes the lake to visitors and only gives Fera and Eiva access. On the train
to the refugee camp, Fera is angered when Raf continues to cry over losing the
pregnancy and feeling sick in the presence of Fera and Eiva. Fera and Eiva move
away from Raf. They snuggle up together. Fera says she feels weird sleeping
next to Eiva. Eiva tells her to shut up and enjoy it, which Fera does.

"What the hell is this romantic subplot nonsense?"

"Why do you say subplot? Our romance could be the main plot. The revolution has
waited for thousands of years. It can wait a few more years while you show me
around the modern world."

"Can we do both? People are suffering. I want our lives to be a trashy 'Girls'
Love' novel, but we need to make an impact."

"I knew I picked the right person to lead the resurgence."

"They're calling you the Bone Queen."

"I don't like it. Have them call me something else."

"Skeleton Queen?"

"That's even worse. Any other ideas?"

"Reine des os, but that's Queen of Bones, not Bone Queen."

"Raf Dezo? I like how that sounds! That's Ancient French, right?"

"Yes, but we just called it French. It would be great if you could too. You're
making me feel ancient."

"What would it be in Latin?"

"Regina Ossa."

"Regina Ossifraga."

"Regina Ossuaria."

"Regina Ossuosa."

"That's it. Let's go with Queen Ossa."
