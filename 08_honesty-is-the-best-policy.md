## Chapter 8: Honesty is the best policy

Kaia is captured by the scenders who want to transfer her consciousness so they
can study it. Ben and Ed try to convince her to join them willingly, offering
Pert as a peace offering. Pert reveals that Zek paid him to act her in the
refugee camp, so he could look like a hero. Ben reveals that Ursa is an scender,
who used to be a man. Ben explains that many scenders think life in the physical
world should end, because it is wasteful, inefficient, and help humanity learn
anything new. Ben and Ed believe in life in the physical world and want Kaia to
transcend to prove that physical life is worthwhile. Kaia is rescued by Zek,
Ursa, and Figa. She returns to the silo to live with Fera and Sata, because Zek
paid Pert to attack her so he could be a hero and Ursa did not tell her about
previously being a man even though they went skinny dipping in the lake before
and had other intimate moments.
