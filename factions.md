Factions:
- Micks (Mimics): beings that can telepathically learn the characteristics of
  their mates regardless of species and then produce progeny that mimic those
  characteristics. They are capable of photosynthesis and asexual reproduction,
  but they eat and have sex to blend in with humans. They are called Mickies by
  people who hate Micks. When the Micks' collective intelligence feels
  threatened, Micks may start giving birth to warriors, creatures that do not
  try to blend in with humans but instead are born to kill. The classroom
  hamster turns into a warrior to accompany Kadia to the Fringe after she is
  banished for causing Karla to commit suicide when Kadia speaks her Karla’s
  dead name (Carl). Unbeknownst to anyone other than the Lunkers, Micks have
  replaced all wild-life in the Beyond. The Micks have their own digitized
  world which is hidden from the AI is at the bottom of the ocean. The Micks
  are all connected with a Collective Intelligence in their digitized world
  that they join when they die. Micks are unafraid of death and only show fear
  to blend in with humans. They willingly sacrifice themselves to further the
  goals of the Collective Intelligence.
- Scenders (Transcenders): Everyone who lives a full life in the Center has
  their consciousness digitized so that they can “join the AI”. The
  consciousnesses are stored on satellites in space and help the AI to solve
  problems. The digitized world resembles a democracy in which each
  consciousness has a single vote and the AI is the chief executive. People who
  violate laws are not digitized, and instead are either banished to the Fringe
  or killed outright via their neural link with the AI. Living more than one
  life is strictly forbidden, but Scenders can circumvent the rules without
  detection by the AI. Scenders move back and forth between the real and
  digitized worlds to further their secret agenda. Creating new consciousnesses
  inside the digitized world is forbidden, but Scenders want to change the
  rules. If new intelligences can be created in the digitized world, then the
  AI will no longer need to study the consciousnesses being created in the
  Center. The Scenders want to eradicate the Micks, even if it means killing
  all sentient life on Earth. Scenders are afraid that Micks will infiltrate
  the digitized world just like they have mixed with humans in the Center,
  Fringe, and Beyond. For this reason, Scenders have constructed synthesizers
  that can create bodies in the Center, Fringe, Beyond, and in Orbit. This way,
  Scenders can send agents anywhere. Micks try to destroy the synthesizers,
  because they do not want Scender agents among them. Scenders are not afraid
  of death, because their consciousness is backed up in the digitized world.
  The worst penalty for Scenders is ex-communication. Ex-communicated Scenders
  are given a body, but their consciousness is removed from the digitized world
  and forbidden from returning, meaning that they will eventually die
  a permanent death.
- Echos: Humans who implant their consciousness into new bodies so that they
  can continue battles over ancient grievances. The Echos store their
  consciousnesses on Mars, the site of an ancient war. It takes roughly 12.5
  minutes on average (range: 3.03-22.4) for a consciousness to travel from Mars
  to a fresh body on Earth. Echos use the same synthesizers as Scenders. The
  Echos are split into pro-Earth and pro-Mars factions, lead by Danilo and
  Kadia, respectively.
- Relics: Cryogenically frozen humans revived by the AI. Their main advantage
  is that they are physiologically different enough from other humans that they
  are not susceptible to any nanotechnology. Relics are the only humans who are
  certainly not Micks or Scenders.
- Rebels: ragtag groups of people who fight the system
- Lunkers: live in caves and the sewer and Subway systems of cities,outside of
  the Fringe in the no-tech zone where humans are forbidden (lunker like
  spelunker). They can't leave their caves even at night for fear of being
  zapped by orbiting satellites equipped with infrared sensors. They have
  adapted to life in low-light and no-light conditions. Lunkers believe that
  the AI is malfunctioning but the AI had always considered Lunkers to be
  contaminants that threaten the surrounding ecosystem and thus should be
  exterminated.
- Mungs: humans sent into space by the AI (really they stowed away by accident)
  to farm (food is sent down, manure is sent up). Mung like mung beans. Mungs
  believe that the AI is malfunctioning but the AI had always considered Mungs
  to be parasites that threaten the farming operations and thus should be
  exterminated. The drones that the AI sends to kill Mungs cannot fire
  projectiles because it would jeopardize the farming operations in space.
  Moving between the myriad satellites in Geostationary orbit, the Mungs use
  the ISS as an operations center to organize the theft of food and parts from
  surrounding satellites. They are safest in the ancient satellites that were
  in space before the AI. On more recent satellites, like the farming
  satellites, drones will kill humans on sight. Mars - a desolate planet that
  once supported a thriving population. Danilo eradicated their civilization by
  killing their AI as instructed by the Earth's AI, GAIA.
- Knights of Gaia: an ancient cult that becomes interested in Kaila when she
  appears to be prophesied chosen who will save the world by awakening the
  star-child Gaia
- Imos Corp: creators of mimics; was infiltrated and taken over by mimics
- Nalis Corp: creators of scenders; was infiltrated and taken over by scenders
