## Chapter 3: A beautiful view

The sound of the fire alarm was brutal. Kaia and Sata woke up in total
darkness, not remember where they were or why. As her eyes adjusted to light,
Kaia saw she was in the secret bed next to Sata. A glint of metal caught Kaia's
eye, she recoiled in horror when she that her hand was covered thin metal
wires. Kaia kicked off the bed covers, the metallic tendrils covering her
body were beginning to envelop Sata. In a panic, Kaia tore at the tendrils trying
to rip them away from Sata. Sata looked at Kaia in shock.

"Kaia, what are you doing?"

"I'm trying to-" The tendrils were gone.

"Sata, Kaia," Aira said, running up to the edge of the bed, "put on these
shoes." Aira handed each of the girls a pair of ballet flats from a satchel she
wore across her shoulder, "Just slip them on and let's go. Fera and Ryn left
while you were sleeping."

"It could be just a drill," Sata said.

"We will find out when we get outside," Aira responded.

As they were leaving the theater, a huge explosion rocked the school.

"Ok, it's definitely not a drill," Sata said.

Outside the theater, there was utter pandemonium. Students and animalAutomatons
were running towards the exits. The three girls followed the crowd heading to
the main exit. Surprised that she could run at all, Kaia marvelled at how
comfortable the ballet flats were to run in.

"How did you know our sizes?", Kaia asked Aira.

"I took your shoes off while you were sleeping. Your shoes were in pretty bad
shape. I hope you don't mind."

"Oh, I don't mind at all. These shoes are much better."

When the girls made it outside, Sata and Kaia were dismayed to see Pyr and his
posse waiting in front of the entrance to the school. Pyr's head was wrapped
in bandages. A small of blood had permeated the bandages in the spot were the
historianHummingbird had hit him.

"What's wrong? Afraid of a little fire-", Pyr started, but the paused as he
inspected the girls more closely.

"Wait a second. Did you replace one of your girlfriends already?", Pyr said to
Kaia, "You just love 'em and leave 'em, don't ya? You go through girls faster
than I do!"

The boys erupted with laughter.

Before the Kaia and Sata could think of a plan, Aira walked up to Pyr and
introduced herself.

"Hello, I'm Aira. What's your name?", Aira said, projecting her voice so
everyone hear as if she were on stage.

"Pyr, but you can call me the Pyrinator, and this is my Posse, I call them
Pyr's Posse," Pyr said, flexing his muscles and gesturing at the boys behind
him.

"Nice to meet you, Pyr! What happened to your head?"

"Oh, this? It's nothing." Pyr was clearly not used to anyone of the opposite
sex taking an interest in him.

"A bird flew into his head," Sata said.

"What did you say?" Pyr pushed past Aira and stood menacingly in front of
Kaia and Sata.

"I said, a bird flew into your head," Sata said defiantly.

"What are the chances of a bird flying into someone's head?" Aira interrupted.
She really knew how to make her voice carry.

"Pyr must really be an airhead," Sata said, cracking a smile.

"He's a real chick magnet!" Kaia said exploding with laughter.

"He gives new meaning to the word bird-brained!" Sata added, laughing even
harder. A few hours of sleep had done them both a lot of good.

Pyr moved closer to Sata and Kaia and spoke in a low voice. "Listen, I know you
are one mistake away from going to prison, so you better start treating me
really nicely or I might have a word with my father and-." At that moment, a
bird flew into the previously undamaged side of Pyr's head.

"What are the chances of two different birds flying into the same person's
head?" Aira asked as she grabbed Kaia and Sata by the hands and led them away
through the circle of stunned boys.

"He got two birds with one head!" Sata screamed as they ran, hoping everyone
could hear her. Laughing hysterically, Kaia did not try to come up with any
more bird puns, because she knew she would not be able to top that last one.

When the girls arrived at the emergency meeting point, a very sharply dressed
young man waved at them enthusiastically and began to run in their direction.
Aira squealed with glee and began to run towards him.

"Airunia!" the young man yelled.

"Lanselolek!" Aira responded.

They hugged and spun around, laughing like children. When Kaia and Sata walked
up to them, Aira put her arm around the young man and gestured towards the two
girls.

"Lan, this is Kaia and Sata. Kaia and Sata, this is Lan."

Lan stepped forward and bowed with a flourish. "Very pleased to make your
acquaintance. Any friend of my Airunianunia is a friend of mine! Please, follow
me. I have the best seats in the best airship reserved for us."

"Airship?!" Aira exclaimed. Lan stopped and looked at the girls. "Haven't you
heard?! The entire city is going to explode! We have to be ready to evacuate as
soon as we get the signal."

"We have to go back for Ryn and Fera.", Kaia said.

"Oh no, I'm afraid that will be absolutely impossible! Anyone trying to leave
this area will be executed immediately to ensure a safe and organized
evacuation."

"How is executing people going to ensure safety?"

"I don't know, I don't make the rules, but I do know that the snipers on the
roof mean business."

The girls look up at the rooftops and saw gunmen covering all of the possible
exits.

"I'm sure everyone will make it onto an airship just fine. It seems like
they're in no hurry to launch, but we might as well wait inside. Come on, our
airship is stocked with goodies. I think some refreshments might do you some
good. You all look positively parched and famished!"

As they approached a regal looking airship, Lan suddenly changed course waving
towards a strike team officer with one hand and pulling Aira behind him. The
strike team officer looked very intimidating. His face was hidden behind a
black balaclava and dark sunglasses. He was resting his hands on a massive
rifle that was slung over his shoulder. The exoskeleton armor he was wearing
made him look could wrestle a guardGorilla and win.

"Officer Kransal!" Lan exclaimed. "I'd like to introduce you to Aira and her
friends Kaia and Sata."

Getting behind Aira, Lan whispered something into her ear, carefully took her
satchel, and gently nudged her forward. Aira adjusted her hair and approached
the officer shyly, but pretty soon they were standing next to each other as
they posed for a picture together. Aira's face was flushed with emotion as
beamed at the pictureParrot that perched in front of them. She put her hand on
Officer Kransal's arm and leaned into him as he stood motionless. After the
picture, she came back to stand next to Kaia and Sata.

Lan walked up to Officer Kransal and stood next to him speaking in a hushed
tone. The officer nodded, then Lan stuck out his elbow and two briefly
connected elbows. As they resumed their trajectory to the airship, Lan was
smiling ear to ear.

"It's all taken care of. Thanks to Aira, our airship has official VIP
designation and all of the best local shops are being requisitioned for the
best supplies. We have complete control of the guest list. If anyone gives us
any trouble, we can have them thrown out. And the best part is that Officer
Kransal will be flying with us as our personal security escort."

Aira was blushing deeply and she pulled in Kaia and Sata on either side of her.

"Are you crying?" Kaia asked.

"Not here. Wait until we get onto the airship.", Aira replied smiling broadly
through the tears.

As soon as they were in the gangway of the airship, Aira pulled Kaia and Sata
into a huddle as Lan was on the lookout.

"That officer is a Lunker," Aira said as tears dropped down on the ground in
front of her.

Kaia and Sata were waiting to hear more, but what followed was a bit
anticlimactic. "You mustn't tell anyone anything!".

After wiping her face, Aira pulled the two girls up the gangway into the
airship. The interior of the airship was impeccably stylish and as far they
could tell completely empty.

"I'm going to freshen up.", Aira said quickly, "Lan, will you take care of our
guests?"

Lan launched into his role as host with bravado. He first offered his guests a
selection of beverages and did an excellent job hiding his disappointment when
he found out that he guests only wanted regular water to drink. Lan lifted a
silver cover with a flourish to reveal a veritable cornucopia of
delicious-looking foods.

The two girls began to eat with abandon using their hands to shuttle food from
the platter directly to their mouths. Lan started to explain the unique origins
and laud the quality of each food item, but then he fell silent when he
realized no one was listening to him. Kaia could not help but noticed that Lan
was growing increasingly uneasy as they ate, but she could not resist the food.
After the girls cleared almost all of the food on the platter, they looked up
at Lan with gratitude.

"That was the best meal I've had in my life," Sata said. Kaia
enthusiastically agreed. "I couldn't eat another bite!"

"Should we have saved some for Aira?", Kaia asked, trying to guess why Lan
looked so uncomfortable.

"Oh no, we have plenty of food and there's even more being loaded now."

"Lan, did we do something wrong?", Kaia asked quietly.

"Heavens no, you two are absolutely perfect. I was just hoping that you might
save a little room for the soup, salad, main course, and dessert, but I am so
glad that you enjoyed the appetizer tray so much-" Lan stopped mid-sentence as
his face started to quiver.

"I am really sorry we ate all the appetizers. We'll be hungry again soon I
promise!", Kaia said trying to cheer up Lan, but he burst into tears, using the
bend in his elbow to cover his face.

Kaia sat down next to Lan and put her hand on his shoulder unsure of how to
console him. When Lan lifted his tear-soaked face to look at Kaia, she was
stunned to see the deep sorrow in eyes. There was clearly more to the story
than the appetizer tray. Lan gently leaned into Kaia for a hug, his body was
occasionally wracked by sobs as he unleashed a waterfall of emotion onto her
shoulder. When he stopped crying, he looked at Kaia lovingly.

Aira arrives looking gorgeous. Both Kaia and Sata are very impressed. Lan
wipes his eyes and continues entertaining. Aira is anxious for Officer Kransal
to arrive. When he does, she runs up to him and throws her arms around him.
Officer Kransal removes and stows away his armor along with his rifle. Without
the armor, he looks much smaller, but still very intimidating. After they talk
and eat, Kransal tells them they can call him Taz as long as his not in uniform
or on duty. Aira announces that she is going to show Officer Kransal around.
When Kaia asks if they can come too, Lan says that he will show Kaia and Sata
around later, separately.

Are you a Lunker too?
A Lunker?! I was born to shine under the spotlight, not hide in the shadows!

"Earlier, I thought you and Aira together. I don't think that now, obviously."
"Me with Aira?! Oh no, a leading man needs a leading lady." Lan said.

"Let me introduce you to subject of my affection, but please you mustn't tell
anyone anything."

Lan introduces Sata and Kaia to Ursa. They knock on the door to Ursa's cabin,
Ursa opens. Sata and Kaia are both extremely impressed with how elegant,
beautiful, and athletic Ursa is.

Zek and Zok barge in on them with Iona in tow. Zek and Zok try their best to
charm Kaia. Kaia is unsure why he is focusing on her, when she hasn't fixed her
appearance since before the ceremony. The airship begins to go down when Kaia
has a dream about the mummy queen destroying the airship fuel cells. Zek and
Zok demonstrate their leadership skills and relationships with Iona and Ursa to
save the day. They give commands to Ursa and Iona, both of whom are incredibly
strong and athletic. Ursa is always cheerful. Iona never smiles.

A beautiful view, the chapter title, refers to the lake Zakrzówek and also the
girls bathing.

Zek and Zok spy on the girls.

The airship crashes in a lake and sinks to the bottom. Zok and Ursa dives into
the lake and recovers supplies for them. Lan annoys them by asking for more and
more supplies. Iona refuses to get in the water. Since it was already dark,
they decided to make camp at the airship crash site. They talk around the camp
fire. Someone notices that Kransal and Aira's eyes glow in the dark. All of the
girls walk along the side of lake to find a spot to bathe. Kransal, Zek, and
Lan stay behind. Iona waits by the side of the lake. "I don't do water." The
girls have fun in the water. Kaia is amazed at how great Sata, Aira, and
especially Ursa look. Aira and Ursa are surprised to see how Kaia looks
underneath all the grime.

The Chapter ends when everyone falls asleep next to the campfire. Kaia curls up
next to Sata.
