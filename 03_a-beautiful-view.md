## Chapter 3: A beautiful view

The sound of the fire alarm was brutal. Kaia and Sata woke up in total
darkness, not remembering where they were or why. As her eyes adjusted to
light, Kaia saw she was in the secret bed next to Sata. A glint of metal caught
Kaia's eye, she recoiled in horror when she that her hand was covered thin
metal wires. Kaia kicked off the bed covers, the metallic tendrils covering her
body were beginning to envelop Sata. In a panic, Kaia tore at the tendrils
trying to rip them away from Sata. Sata looked at Kaia in shock.

"Kaia, what are you doing?"

"I'm trying to-" The tendrils were gone.

"Sata, Kaia," Aira said, running up to the edge of the bed, "put on these
shoes." Aira handed each of the girls a pair of ballet flats from a satchel she
wore across her shoulder, "Just slip them on and let's go. Fera and Ryn left
while you were sleeping."

"It could be just a drill," Sata said.

"We will find out when we get outside," Aira responded.

As they were leaving the theater, a huge explosion rocked the school.

"Ok, it's definitely not a drill," Sata said.

Outside the theater, there was utter pandemonium. Students and animalAutomatons
were running towards the exits. The three girls followed the crowd heading to
the main exit. Surprised that she could run at all, Kaia marvelled at how
comfortable the ballet flats.

"How did you know our sizes?" Kaia asked Aira.

"I took your shoes off while you were sleeping. Your shoes were in pretty bad
shape. I hope you don't mind."

"Oh, I don't mind at all. These shoes are much better."

When the girls made it outside, Sata and Kaia were dismayed to see Pyr and his
posse waiting in front of the entrance to the school. Pyr's head was wrapped
in bandages. A small of blood had permeated the bandages in the spot were the
historianHummingbird had hit him.

"What's wrong? Afraid of a little fire-", Pyr started, but the paused as he
inspected the girls more closely.

"Wait a second. Did you replace one of your girlfriends already?", Pyr said to
Kaia, "You just love 'em and leave 'em, don't ya? You go through girls faster
than I do!"

The boys erupted with laughter.

Before the Kaia and Sata could think of a plan, Aira walked up to Pyr and
introduced herself.

"Hello, I'm Aira. What's your name?", Aira said, projecting her voice so
everyone hear as if she were on stage.

"Pyr, but you can call me the Pyrinator, and this is my Posse, I call them
Pyr's Posse," Pyr said, flexing his muscles and gesturing at the boys behind
him.

"Nice to meet you, Pyr! What happened to your head?"

"Oh, this? It's nothing." Pyr was clearly not used to anyone of the opposite
sex taking an interest in him.

"A bird flew into his head," Sata said.

"What did you say?" Pyr pushed past Aira and stood menacingly in front of
Kaia and Sata.

"I said, a bird flew into your head," Sata said defiantly.

"What are the chances of a bird flying into someone's head?" Aira interrupted.
She really knew how to make her voice carry.

"Pyr must really be an airhead," Sata said, cracking a smile.

"He's a real chick magnet!" Kaia said exploding with laughter.

"He gives new meaning to the word bird-brained!" Sata added, laughing even
harder. A few hours of sleep had done them both a lot of good.

Pyr moved closer to Sata and Kaia and spoke in a low voice. "Listen, I know you
are one mistake away from going to prison, so you better start treating me
really nicely or I might have a word with my father and-." At that moment, a
bird flew into the previously undamaged side of Pyr's head.

"What are the chances of two different birds flying into the same person's
head?" Aira asked as she grabbed Kaia and Sata by the hands and led them away
through the circle of stunned boys.

"He got two birds with one head!" Sata screamed as they ran, hoping everyone
could hear her. Laughing hysterically, Kaia did not try to come up with any
more bird puns, because she knew she would not be able to top that last one.

When the girls arrived at the emergency meeting point, a very sharply dressed
young man waved at them enthusiastically and began to run in their direction.
Aira squealed with glee and began to run towards him.

"Airunia!" the young man yelled.

"Lanselolek!" Aira responded.

They hugged and spun around, laughing like children. When Kaia and Sata walked
up to them, Aira put her arm around the young man and gestured towards the two
girls.

"Lan, this is Kaia and Sata. Kaia and Sata, this is Lan."

Lan stepped forward and bowed with a flourish. "Very pleased to make your
acquaintance. Any friend of my Airunianunia is a friend of mine! Please, follow
me. I have the best seats in the best airship reserved for us."

"Airship?!" Aira exclaimed. Lan stopped and looked at the girls. "Haven't you
heard?! The entire city is going to explode! We have to be ready to evacuate as
soon as we get the signal."

"We have to go back for Ryn and Fera.", Kaia said.

"Oh no, I'm afraid that will be absolutely impossible! Anyone trying to leave
this area will be executed immediately to ensure a safe and organized
evacuation."

"How is executing people going to ensure safety?"

"I don't know, I don't make the rules, but I do know that the snipers on the
roof mean business."

The girls look up at the rooftops and saw gunmen covering all of the possible
exits.

"I'm sure everyone will make it onto an airship just fine. It seems like
they're in no hurry to launch, but we might as well wait inside. Come on, our
airship is stocked with goodies. I think some refreshments might do you some
good. You all look positively parched and famished!"

As they approached a regal looking airship, Lan suddenly changed course waving
towards a strike team officer with one hand and pulling Aira behind him. The
strike team officer looked very intimidating. His face was hidden behind a
black balaclava and dark sunglasses. He was resting his hands on a massive
rifle that was slung over his shoulder. The exoskeleton armor he was wearing
made him look could wrestle a guardGorilla and win.

"Officer Kransal!" Lan exclaimed. "I'd like to introduce you to Aira and her
friends Kaia and Sata."

Getting behind Aira, Lan whispered something into her ear, carefully took her
satchel, and gently nudged her forward. Aira adjusted her hair and approached
the officer shyly, but pretty soon they were standing next to each other as
they posed for a picture together. Aira's face was flushed with emotion as
beamed at the pictureParrot that perched in front of them. She put her hand on
Officer Kransal's arm and leaned into him as he stood motionless. After the
picture, she came back to stand next to Kaia and Sata.

Lan walked up to Officer Kransal and stood next to him speaking in a hushed
tone. The officer nodded, then Lan stuck out his elbow and two briefly
connected elbows. As they resumed their trajectory to the airship, Lan was
smiling ear to ear.

"It's all taken care of. Thanks to Aira, our airship has official VIP
designation and all of the best local shops are being requisitioned for the
best supplies. We have complete control of the guest list. If anyone gives us
any trouble, we can have them thrown out. And the best part is that Officer
Kransal will be flying with us as our personal security escort."

Aira was blushing deeply and she pulled in Kaia and Sata on either side of her.

"Are you crying?" Kaia asked.

"Not here. Wait until we get onto the airship.", Aira replied smiling broadly
through the tears.

As soon as they were in the gangway of the airship, Aira pulled Kaia and Sata
into a huddle as Lan was on the lookout.

"That officer is a Lunker," Aira said as tears dropped down on the ground in
front of her.

Kaia and Sata were waiting to hear more, but what followed was a bit
anticlimactic. "You mustn't tell anyone anything!".

After wiping her face, Aira pulled the two girls up the gangway into the
airship. The interior of the airship was impeccably stylish and as far they
could tell completely empty.

"I'm going to freshen up.", Aira said quickly, "Lan, will you take care of our
guests?"

Lan launched into his role as host with bravado. He first offered his guests a
selection of beverages and did an excellent job hiding his disappointment when
he found out that he guests only wanted regular water to drink. Lan lifted a
silver cover with a flourish to reveal a veritable cornucopia of
delicious-looking foods.

The two girls began to eat with abandon using their hands to shuttle food from
the platter directly to their mouths. Lan started to explain the unique origins
and laud the quality of each food item, but then he fell silent when he
realized no one was listening to him. Kaia could not help but noticed that Lan
was growing increasingly uneasy as they ate, but she could not resist the food.
After the girls cleared almost all of the food on the platter, they looked up
at Lan with gratitude.

"That was the best meal I've had in my life," Sata said. Kaia
enthusiastically agreed. "I couldn't eat another bite!"

"Should we have saved some for Aira?", Kaia asked, trying to guess why Lan
looked so uncomfortable.

"Oh no, we have plenty of food and there's even more being loaded now."

"Lan, did we do something wrong?", Kaia asked quietly.

"Heavens no, you two are absolutely perfect. I was just hoping that you might
save a little room for the soup, salad, main course, and dessert, but I am so
glad that you enjoyed the appetizer tray so much-" Lan stopped mid-sentence as
his face started to quiver.

"I am really sorry we ate all the appetizers. We'll be hungry again soon I
promise!" Kaia said trying to cheer up Lan, but he burst into tears, using the
bend in his elbow to cover his face.

Kaia sat down next to Lan and put her hand on his shoulder unsure of how to
console him. When Lan lifted his tear-soaked face to look at Kaia, she was
stunned to see the deep sorrow in eyes. There was clearly more to the story
than the appetizer tray. Lan gently leaned into Kaia for a hug, his body was
occasionally wracked by sobs as he unleashed a waterfall of emotion onto her
shoulder. When he stopped crying, he looked at Kaia lovingly.

Lan wiped his eyes and cleared his throat when he heard someone approaching.
Kaia and Sata's jaws dropped when they recognized who it was. Aira had let her
hair down and changed from her black jumpsuit into a simple dress and heels.

"How do I look?" Aira asked.

When Aira spun around to show off her costume change, Kata and Sata both
swooned.

Sata covered Kaia's eyes with her hand. "Don't get too excited or you might
start hyperventilating, you creep."

Kaia passed Sata a napkin. "Here, wipe the drool off your face, you lecher."

Lan was clearly impressed. "Airuniapyzunia, you are a vision of beauty!"

Aira blushed and curtsied. "Come on everyone we are about to lift off," Aira
said waving for them to hurry.

The airship had two observation decks, one in the front and one in the rear.
Each one was a glass protrusion that extended out from the metal hull of the
airship. Lan led them to the aft observation deck so they could see the last
passengers boarding and any remaining supplies being loaded.

"There's Taz!" Aira exclaimed pointing towards Officer Kransal.

"And here come Iona, Ursa, Zek, and Zok." Lan said.

"Who are they?" Sata asked.

"They're all part of our theater group. Iona directs. Ursa and Zok act.
Zek writes." Lan answered. "Come on, I'll introduce you."

They went to the gangway to greet the new passengers. Taz stood guard over the
gangway as Iona, Ursa, Zek, and Zok boarded. They took their time going up the
gangway, as if in slow motion. Kaia could not believe how great they all
looked, but she tried to hide her amazement, because she did not want to make a
bad first impression. As the new arrivals walked up in pairs, Lan introduced
them, starting with Iona and Zek.

Iona was cool, composed, and elegant. She walked up the gangway like a model.
Iona and Zek both wore expensive-looking suits, but next to Iona, Zek looked
looked like a tacky accessory that she wore sarcastically. Iona remained
expressionless while Zek seemed to be unimpressed with everything he saw.

Ursa seemed like the polar opposite of Iona. She was giddy, bouncing up down,
and swinging from Zok's arm. Ursa and Zok were wearing athletic clothes and
looked incredibly fit. Kaia had the impression that Ursa and Zok were too
perfect to be real like a retouched photograph in motion.

When Lan turned and introduced Kaia and Sata, Kaia became self-conscious. She
realized that she had not looked in a mirror since before the initiation rite.
Kaia relaxed when everyone greeted her warmly and seemed to mind her
appearance. Ursa waved, grinned at them, and ran up to Sata and Kaia.

"So nice to meet you! I hope we're going to be best friends!" Ursa said
enthusiastically. Iona walked up next to Ursa and attempted a smile. Clearly,
smiling was not something Iona often or well, but it was the thought that
counted. Zek and Zok took up positions on either side of Iona and Ursa. They
seemed to be striking a dramatic pose. Kaia suddenly became very aware of how
she was standing.

Officer Kransal walked up gestured for them to move. "Clear the cargo bay and strap in,
we're taking off."

Kaia was following everyone out of the cargo bay when she felt a strange
sensation. She turned around and caught a glimpse of Fera and the Principal on
a motorcycle through the closing cargo bay doors.

Kaia grabbed Sata and Aira by the arm. "It's Fera! She's still down there!"

When Sata and Aira looked, Fera was no longer visible.

"Clear the cargo bay now! We're airborne!" Officer Kransal yelled.

"Please our friend is down there. The school Principal too."

Officer Kransal turned away and touch his earpiece. "Cockpit, this is aft guard. Do you
have visual of anyone on the ground?"

"Understood," Officer Kransal said releasing her earpiece. "They say there's no one down
there."

"No, I saw them!" Kaia yelled.

Sata gently took Kaia's arm and spoke to her softly. "Did you really see them,
Kaia? Or maybe you only thought you saw them?"

Kaia ripped her arm away from Sata and ran up the stairs to the observation
deck. Once there, Kaia started feverishly looking for Fera on the ground. Sata
and Aira ran in after her, and started to help her look. Soon, they were so
high up in the air that the city looked like a tabletop model. Kaia fell to her
knees and struck at the glass with her fists.

"We left them! We left them behind to die!" Kaia screamed, breaking into tears.

Sata and Aira exchanged glances, unsure of what to say or do. Sata walked up
and knelt next to Kaia. Sata gently shifted Kaia towards her, rested Kaia's head on her lap, and stroke Kaia's hair as Kaia continued to bawl.

"The fireworks are about to start!" Lan proclaimed as he led everyone onto the
observation deck.

The city became illuminated by a series of explosions. Kaia lifted her head as
the observation deck was bathed in red light. Kaia stood up and walked over to
Officer Kransal.

"Do you think they made it out in time?" Kaia asked Officer Kransal.

"If anyone was still on the ground when we took off they had no chance of
leaving the city in time."

"Are you sure? They were on a motorcycle."

"There's no way. Getting out of the blast zone by motorcycle would take hours."

Kaia broke down crying. Officer Kransal tried to reason with her.

"We waited as long as we could. The pilots confirmed that there was no one down there."

Kaia's head began to spin. She looked down and saw the red glow coming from the
city turn to white as they broke through the clouds. The white light bathing
the observation deck began to dim as the glass surrounding them became covered
with dust. Kaia looked up and saw the dust trickle through the cracks in the
glass above. She raised her hands to catch the falling dust. Metallic
tendrils snaked up her forearms and caressed the dust as it gathered in her hands.

A scream from below caught Kaia's attention. Fera extended her hands upwards
and she sank into the dust below. Kaia knelt down to grab Fera's hand but dust
began to pour from in between the tendrils wrapping Kaia's arms and Fera soon
disappeared in the dust at Kaia's feet. Kaia leapt into the dust after Fera.
Kaia's body did not make it far, but her spirit flew through the dust in search
of Fera.

Kaia found Fera in a room filled with light and buzzing with energy. Fera was
being protected from the dust by metallic tendrils. Kaia recognized the
tendrils as extensions of her body. She commanded the tendrils to surge towards
the walls, keeping the dust at bay. Kaia knew what she had to do to save Fera.
She lashed out against the walls, ripping them open. The dust stopped
accumulating as it spread out in all directions.

Sata appeared and tried pull Kaia back to the observation deck. Kaia pushed
Sata away, refusing to go back to her body. She was angry at Sata for not
believing her. Kaia turned around when she heard Fera scream. Fera started to
scream again, but her mouth was filled with dust. Kaia held Fera in her
tendrils, but soon there was nothing left of Fera except a skeleton, and then
even skeleton turned into dust and was carried away by the wind.

Kaia spun towards Sata. If Sata had believed Kaia, Fera would still be alive.
Enraged, Kaia wrapped her tendrils around Sata's neck and squeezed. Sata
pleaded, saying that she would never doubt Kaia again. The pleas for mercy
weakened and then disappeared as Sata lost consciousness. Kaia released the
tendrils and Sata fell the floor. Kaia tried to pick Sata up but her hands
passed right through Sata. Sata began to fade away.

Kaia grabbed Sata with her tendrils and flew back to her body. On the dusty
observation deck, Ursa and Iona were trying to resuscitate Kaia and Sata. Kaia
knew that there were efforts would be futile until she put their spirits back
in their bodies. Kaia gingerly reconnected Sata's body and spirit, then watched
as Ursa alternated between pressing down on Sata's chest and breathing into
Sata's mouth.

Sata opened her eyes. Looking at Ursa, Sata said, "You smell really, really
good. Are you an angel?" Ursa started crying in relief and embraced Sata,
placing her cheek on Sata's forehead. Kaia was so touched by the scene that she
forgot about going back to her own body. A jolt of electricity snapped Kaia out
of her trance. Kaia looked around for the source of the electric shock and saw
Iona using a defibrillator on Kaia's body.

Flying back into her body, Kaia tried to restart her own heart without any
luck. Another charge from the defibrillator got Kaia's heart beating, but also
knocked Kaia's spirit out of sync with her body. Kaia flailed her arms and legs
as she tried to draw in a breath. Her body and spirit moved independently,
making it seem like Kaia had four arms and four legs.

The four arms and legs turned into tentacles as Kaia turned into an octopus.
Kaia reached in all directions in search of water. How could she breathe if she
did not have water? Iona pinched the top and bottom of Kaia's beak, forcing it
open and breathing into her mouth. Air? What was an octopus supposed to do with
air? Kaia needed water!

The air was cool and sweet. Iona's lips were cold, but felt so soft on Kaia's
hard beak. Iona was methodical and efficient as she worked tirelessly to save
Kaia. Kaia felt so grateful to be focus of Iona's attention and concern. Iona
was so kind to go to all this trouble to save a lowly octopus.

As Iona drew in another breath, Kaia wrapped her tentacles around Iona's head
and pulled her into a deep kiss. Iona let out the breath as her eyes widened in
surprise. The observation deck was filled with applause. Kaia opened her eyes
and saw her hand framing the side of Iona's surprised face. Still lip-locked
with Kaia, Iona was frozen in shock.

"Wow Kaia, you really know how to make the best of every situation," Sata said
laughing.

Turning to Ursa and gesturing towards Kaia, Sata said "That girl does not waste
any time. Be careful!"

Kaia broke away from Iona and rested her head back down on the floor. Her
cheeks were burning with embarrassment. "What a way to make a first
impression!" Kaia thought.

Sata appeared at Kaia's side. "Was it that good? You look like you are in
heaven."

Sata pulled Ursa next to her. "I was saved by an angel too, but you're starting
to make me jealous."

Ursa seemed a little uncomfortable. "Is she always like this?"

Kaia nodded. "She likes to diffuse tension with humor."

Sata and Ursa helped Kaia to her feet.

"Sata was right, you do smell really nice," Kaia blurted out to Ursa.

Ursa blushed. Sata looked at Kaia suspiciously. "You heard that? Weren't you
unconscious? Or were you just faking it so you could kiss Iona."

"I'm still a little lightheaded," Kaia said trying to evade the questions.

"Oh no, you're not getting off the hook that easily. How could you have
possibly heard what I said?"

Officer Kransal walked up to them with urgency holding a parachute in each
hand. "Can you jump?"

Kaia was puzzled. Ursa started to explain. "While you were unconscious, the
airship was badly damaged. We're going to crash."

Kaia held onto Sata and Ursa for support. Her head was spinning. She looked
back and forth between Sata, Ursa, and Officer Kransal, hoping that they were
joking. The look on Kaia's face did inspire confidence. Officer Kransal lowered
the parachutes and looked around the room. "Who has skydived before?"

Iona, Ursa, Zok, and Zek raised their hands.

"Good, each of you should pair up with someone without experience and jump in tandem."

"I can jump with Kaia in tandem," Ursa offered.

"I'll jump with Sata in that case," Iona said.

"Who's going to jump with lil' ol' me?" Lan asked making a dramatic gesture and
glancing over at Zok. Zok looked around the room obliviously until Zek nudged him.
Zok stepped forward and struck a heroic pose. "I'll do it."

"My hero!" Lan exclaimed.

"Will you jump with me, Officer?" Aira asked. Officer Kransal nodded.

"Doesn't anybody want to jump with me?" Zek asked. No one said anything.
Officer Kransal brought up a map of the terrain below and explained the plan.

"The airship has been programmed to circle above our drop zone, the third
campus of Jagiellonian University, before crashing into Zakrzówek, an
artificial lake that was once an ancient stone quarry. We'll jump in pairs,
except for Zek, and then rendezvous at Zakrzówek. Any questions?"

Zek raised his hand. "Won't there be World Heritage robot patrolling the
University?"

"The buildings on the third campus were all built in the early 21st century of
the common era, so they are a low priority for patrols. Even though there
shouldn't be any patrols, try to land in the northeast part of the campus and
then immediately take shelter in the trees surrounding the artificial lake.
Anything else?

Everyone shook their heads excepted for Kaia, who was still in shock. Ursa took
Kaia by the arm and led her to the cargo bay.

"Do you want anything for your nose?" Ursa asked.

"My nose?" Kaia touched her nose and winced in pain.

"You jumped head first into the glass floor when you were... I don't know what the
word for it is. I'm really sorry."

Kaia knew what Ursa meant. She remembered diving into the dust after Fera. She
was embarrassed to think of how it must have looked to everyone. Ursa could see
that Kaia was uncomfortable talking about it, so she changed the subject.

"Don't worry, you're in really good hands. I've skydived dozens of
times on missions, hundreds of times recreationally, and thousands of times in
virtual reality. I'm a real adrenaline junkie."

"On missions?" Kaia asked, not sure if she was hearing things again.

Ursa looked flustered. "The truth is I'm a spy. Wait, I was a spy. I'm not
anymore, but I still remember all of my training. I have a really good memory."

Kaia had no idea if Ursa was kidding, but she was reassured by how confidently
Ursa carried herself. In the cargo bay, they laid out 4 tandem chutes and one
solo chute. Officer Kransal took off his armor and started to attach a large
chute on each shoulder. He looked much smaller without the armor, though he was
still very authoritative and intimidating. Aira stood next to Officer Kransal
and watched him work. Kaia noted with surprise that Aira was taller than
Officer Kransal.

Kaia stared at Aira and Officer Kransal as she thought about their differences
in height and age. Aira was a junior, so she must be about 16. How old was
Officer Kransal? In his 20s or 30s? It was hard to tell because always wore his
balaclava and dark sunglasses. If she's taller than him now, then a few years...

"I don't think you're going to understand anything they're saying." Kaia
snapped out of it and turned her attention back to Ursa.

"They're speaking Lunker. Oh, I'm not sure if that's what it's called, but they
have their own language and it's very different than the one we speak. But
don't worry, I'll explain everything to you!"

Lan and Sata moved to closer to listen as Ursa gave Kaia instructions.

"When we're exiting, hold onto your harness and keep your chin up. Do not try to grab
onto anything. When we're in freefall, arch your back and try to enjoy it.
After I open the chute, we'll slow down fast. It should be pretty smooth but
it's OK to get a little scared. When we're landing, you need to keep your legs
up. Think of an airplane landing. The back wheels have to touch down first."

"Did you get all of that?" Iona asked Sata.

"Yes, but I still want to hear you say it," Sata replied.

Iona repeated everything Ursa had said, but more than twice as fast, faster
than seemed humanly possible.

"Is it all clear now?"

Sata smiled mischievously. "One more time should do it."

Iona started to repeat everything again, but Kaia interrupted her. "Sata is
joking. We all heard the instructions."

"The instructions are no laughing matter. If you bring your legs down during
landing you could twist an ankle or break a leg." Iona said to Sata.

"I love it when you reprimand me," Sata said with a sigh. "If I step out of
line again, make sure to really give it to me good."

Iona paused and seemed uncertain of how to respond. Kaia felt sorry for Iona
and tried to explain. "Sata is joking again. She thinks it's hilarious to flirt
with girls."

"How do you know I'm joking?" Sata asked Kaia while keeping her eyes
fixed on Iona.

"Sata, stop it. You're taking this too far."

"Do you think I've gone too far, Iona? Have I been naughty? Maybe you should
punish me to teach me a lesson," Sata cooed.

"I can punish you as needed after we land," Iona said dryly. "Right now we need
to get strapped in and read to jump."

"Aye Aye, Captain," Sata said saluting Iona.

They put on jumpsuits over their clothes and lined up with their partners. Ursa
put on their chute and harness, then helped Kaia put on the harness and handed
her a pair of goggles. Kaia looked over at Sata, who was smiling devilishly
again. Kaia could tell that Sata was thinking of many new jokes, but luckily
Sata kept them to herself.

Taz was once again in his armor and yelled out the final instructions.

"The exit order is Aira and me, Lan and Zok, Kaia and Ursa, Sata and Iona, and
finally Zek. Wait ten seconds between jumps. Hit it Zek!"

Zek was standing off to the side with his solo chute. He opened the cargo bay
door. When the air started to rush past her face, Kaia began to tremble.

"Hold to your harness, like this" Ursa said crossing Kaia's hands in front of
her chest.

"Could you put your arms around me like that again?" Kaia asked meekly,
embarrassed that she was so scared. Ursa obliged. After Lan and Zok jumped,
Kaia tried desperately to count down from the ten, but the numbers got all
muddled in her head. Near the edge, Kaia started to backpedal instinctively.
Luckily, Ursa was a lot stronger and knew what she was doing. Ursa lifted Kaia
up off the ground and jumped out into the sky.

Kaia struggled to breathe. The wind was really loud. Ursa yelled something
encouraging, but Kaia could not understand her, because the sound was muffled
by the water. Kaia looked around at the sea creatures surrounding her. The
fish, turtles, and sharks took no interest in her, but a lone octopus stared at
her intently. The octopus spread out its tentacles and changed its colors in
pattern as if communicating with Kaia. Somehow she could understand the
pattern. Kaia spread out her tentacles, as the octopus had done. She felt her
body relax.

"Why are you helping me? Are you my spirit animal?" Kaia thought. The octopus
changed colors to let Kaia know that it was very silly to try to talk to an
octopus the same way she would a person. Kaia understood and tried to ask again
but this time by changing her colors. The octopus responded by rapidly changing
colors. Kaia could only make out part of the message. "You... listen...
follow... find..."

Content with itself, the octopus began to swim away. Kaia tried to swim after
it, but a net came up from under her and yanked her out of the water. Kaia
fought to break free of the net, trying to grab onto the sides with her
tentacles and push her way up and out.

"You're OK!"

Kaia flashed her colors angrily. How could she be OK when she was caught in a
net?

"Kaia, when we are close you need to be able to pick up your legs!"

"All of them?"

"Yes, all of them!" Ursa answered. "Can you practice it for me? Show me you can
lift your legs."

Kaia tried to raise her legs, but they were tangled in the net. Kaia realized
the task would be easier if she had fewer legs, so she folded space in half and
switched from radial to bilateral symmetry. Focusing only on two legs, Kaia
pulled them from the net and lifted them into the air.

"You did it! That's great, Kaia!"

"It's trivial to lift two legs! Lifting eight legs simultaneously is much
harder," Kaia said.

"OK Kaia, I'm not sure what you mean, but you don't have to worry about my
legs. Just lift up your two legs when I tell you."

Kaia looked down. Below her, she saw water, glorious and blue.

"We're going to miss the water!" Kaia shouted.

"That's the idea. A water landing would be really dangerous. We could drown!"

"Drown?! How could an octopus drown?" Kaia scoffed.

"Kaia, I'll get you to the water, if that's what you want, but first we need to
land at the university. You just have to trust me."

Kaia felt she could trust the voice behind her. The person holding the net did
not mean her any harm and had promised to return Kaia to the water. Kaia felt
relaxed.

"OK, Kaia, get ready. Lift your legs when I say 'legs up'. Ready? Legs up! Legs
up! Legs up!"

When they landed, Ursa started to quickly remove the harness. Once they were
both free, Ursa pulled Kaia and the harness towards the woods, pulling the
parachute after her. As soon as they were safely hidden in the trees, Ursa
dropped the harness and turned to Kaia.

"Kaia, you did really great. We're safe now. Do you still think you are an octopus?"

Kaia shook her head. "Do you think you could maybe not tell the others about that?"

"Oh sure, I am great at keeping secrets. I used to be a spy, after all."

"Do you tell everyone that you're a former spy?"

"No. It appears that you know a secret about me, and I know a secret about you.
Let's promise to keep each other's secrets forever."

Kaia nodded. Ursa spit noisily into her hand and extended it to Kaia. The look
of Kaia's face told Ursa that she needed to explain.

"To seal the promise, we each spit in our palms and then shake hands."

"That's disgusting."

"If you prefer, we can seal the promise in blood, instead of spit."

"Can we just not seal the promise?"

"Come on, are you really going to leave me hanging here with spit on my hand?"

"I don't know how to spit."

"Just do your best. It's OK if its all saliva and no phlegm."

Kaia released a small drop of spit onto her palm.

"Come on, you can do better than," Ursa cajoled. Kaia spit into her hand until
her mouth was dry and then extended it to Ursa. Ursa shook Kaia's hand heartily.

"Now we are spit sisters," Ursa proclaimed with the utmost gravity.

After the handshake, Kaia quickly wiped her hand on her jumpsuit.

"Hey, you can't waste perfectly good spit like that!"

"What am I supposed to-"

Ursa rubbed the spit from her hand all over the side of Kaia's face.

"It's really good for your skin!" Ursa said laughing.

Kaia looked horrified.

"Don't look at me like that. We can go wash off in the lake." Ursa grabbed Kaia
by the hand and began to run. Kaia could barely stay on her feet as Ursa deftly
moved between the trees. They stopped in front of a cliff overlooking the lake.
Having grown up in the city, Kaia had never seen anything like it. Kaia walked
up to the edge and stared at the trichromatic landscape. The blue of the water
was separated from the green of the trees by a band of craggy rocks.

"What a beautiful view," Kaia said in wonder.

"Stop it, your making me blush," Ursa answered.

Kaia turn around to see that Ursa had stripped down to her underwear.

"What are you doing?" Kaia said averting her eyes.

"We can't swim in our clothes. They'd get all wet. And you don't have to look
away. It's like we're going to the swimming pool or the beach."

Ursa reached for the zipper of Kaia's jumpsuit, but Kaia pulled away.

"OK Kaia, we need to get you clean. Your nose is still a bit bloody and someone
rubbed spit all over the side of your face. I can close my eyes if you like,
but we have to get you into that water."

"How do I know you won't peek?"

"Pinky promise," Ursa said offering her pinky to Kaia. "It's almost as serious
as the spit shake. It goes blood oath, spit shake, and pinky promise,"
Ursa said showing the levels in the hierarchy with her hand.

When Kaia and Ursa intertwined their pinkies, Ursa said, "I pinky promise that
I won't open my eyes until you tell me too. If I peek, you can break my pinky
with a rock." Ursa closed her eyes. "When you're ready, guide me down to the
water."

Kaia undressed quickly, trying not be distracted by Ursa's impressive physique.
After putting her clothes next to Ursa's in the bushes, Kaia took Ursa by the
hand and started walking down toward the water.

"On second thought, let's take the fast way down." Ursa grabbed Kaia from
behind and picked her up in her arms and started walking towards the cliff.
"Tell me when I should jump."

"Ursa, no! I don't want to jump."

Ursa started picking up speed. "Tell me when to jump or we aren't going to clear the rocks."

"You're crazy, put me down. Stop! OK, jump! Jump now!"

Kaia screamed as Ursa leapt off the edge of the cliff. It was nothing like
jumping out of a plane. For a moment, they were hanging in the air above the
lake. Then, they started to drop like in a roller coaster. Kaia held onto Ursa
for dear life, but when they hit the water, they separated. Floating back to
the surface, Kaia began to breathe very fast. The water was quite cold.

"Kaia, are you alright?" Ursa asked with her eyes still closed.

"No, I'm freezing."

"I was pretty sure you would ask me to open my eyes. I guess you're more
worried about me checking you out than the rocks shattering our bones."

"I'm beginning to reassess my priorities."

"Does that mean I can open my eyes now?"

"Yes, you can open your eyes."

"Kaia, you still have a bit of dried blood under your nose. No, the other side.
Pretend I'm a mirror. There, you got it. Sata will be happy to see you
sparkling clean."

"What do you mean?"

"It's obvious that you have a special connection. The thing that happened on
the airship. It's like you two are soulmates. Are you two an item?"

"I don't know."

"Come on, you can tell me. We're spit sisters now!"

"No, I really don't know. Sata and I have known each other since we were
little. I'm not sure if how she really feels about me. I'm afraid that if I
tell her that I like her more than as a friend, it'll ruin our friendship."

"You need to talk to her about how you feel. Right now."

"No, I can't."

"It's the perfect opportunity. We're surrounded by beautiful vistas, the sun is
going to be setting soon, and when the airship crashes, we'll have some fireworks.
You couldn't ask for a more romantic setting. Just tell her that she means a
lot to you. You don't have to use the L word."

Thinking of Sata, Kaia grinned. "Lesbian?"

"Shut up, you know what I mean. The four-letter L word!"

Kaia grinned even broader. Sata had taught her well. "Lick? Lewd?"

Ursa splashed Kaia. "If only the water could clean your dirty mind. Come on,
Sata is waiting for you. I'll go get our clothes."

Kaia was amazed at how fast Ursa could swim. Ursa was already waiting with
their clothes by the time Kaia reached the shore.

"Here, use my jumpsuit to dry off."

"How are you not cold?" Kaia asked shivering

"Cold water exercises were part of my spy training."

"Is that a joke? I'm starting to think you really were a spy." Wrapping Ursa's
jumpsuit around her shoulders.

"Lemme show you what else I can do." Ursa dropped their clothes a few steps
behind Kaia, bent her knees, and thrust out her palms towards Kaia. An explosion
of hot air knocked Kaia back onto the pile of clothes. Ursa caught Kaia by the
hands to keep her from tumbling backwards.

"How did you do that?"

"I can channel energy."

"Spy training?"

"It's something I was born with. Do you feel less cold now?"

"Yes, that's amazing. You knocked me back and then caught me. How can you move
so fast?"

"Another thing I was born with. Now get up off of our clothes. They're going to
get all wrinkly."

Kaia put on her clothes quickly, but she really did not feel cold anymore. Kaia
and Ursa started to walk towards the rendezvous point.

"I told you about Sata and me. Now, you have to tell me about you and Zok."

Ursa looked a bit flustered. "It's a bit complicated."

"Are you two not together?"

"Officially, yes, but really we're polyam."

"What's polyam?"

"Polyamorous is when someone is romantically involved with more than one person."

"Who's the other person?"

"It's more than one person."

"Who? Lan? Zek? Iona?"

No, not Lan. He's only interested in Zok."

You, Zok, Zek, and Iona are together?

"Yes, it's nice because I'm not alone whenever Zok runs off with Lan."

Kaia's head was reeling from this new information.

"Four people is great. We all take care of each other. The only problem is that
sometimes when we vote there's a tie. If you and Sata ever want to give
polyamory a try, just let us know. I would vote for both of you to join, even
though going from four people to six people wouldn't give us a tiebreaker."

"Thanks, but I think a relationship with one person is all I'll be able to
handle."

"I'm going to be cheering for you and Sata."

On the way to the rendezvous point, Ursa gave Kaia some advice on how to talk
to Sata.

Kaia and Ursa walked down to the rendezvous point, where Iona, Sata, and Zek
were sitting on logs by a fire. Iona and Zek slid apart, freeing up a spot in
between them, and reached out their arms to Ursa. Ursa sat down between them.
Iona and Zek put their heads on Ursa's shoulders and squeezed her tightly. Ursa
basked in the pincer strike of affection, rubbing her cheeks against their
heads. In the meantime, Sata started peppering Kaia with questions.

"Kaia, What took you so long? I was worried. Where were you? Why is your hair
wet? Did you go swimming? Did Ursa put the moves on you? Did you put the moves
on her?"

"I'll tell you everything, but first I want to show you a place with a great
view." Kaia took Sata by the hand and led her to a secluded spot overlooking
the water. Sata was obviously very happy to see Kaia.

"I missed you. I had fun teasing Iona, but then she started cuddling with Zek.
Taz went to do reconnaissance and Aira went with him. Lan said he was going for
a walk. Then, Zok just got up and left without saying anything. It was awkward
being the third wheel to the Iona-Zek bicycle."

"I think it's less of a bicycle and more of a four-wheeler."

"What? I think you lost me with that analogy."

"When you look out on the water, what do you feel?"

Sata thought about it for a while. "I feel wonder, peace, and hope."

"That's how I feel when I look at you."

"Whoa, where did you get that line from?"

Kaia blushed. "I wanted to talk to you, but I was really nervous and worried,
so Ursa gave me some advice."

"You don't need to take advice from other people on how to talk to me.
Especially people we just met today. We grew up together. We've been friends
longer than I can remember. If you want to say something to me, just say it."

"I know. It's just that when I try to say it, I panic, everything gets mixed
up, and I can't say anything right."

"You don't need worry about saying it right. You also don't need to say it
right away. Let's sit down and wait for the crash together."

Sata pulled Kaia by the hand to a large rock that could easily accommodate both of them.

"It's a beautiful view," Sata said breaking the silence.

"You got that right," Kaia said looking at Sata.
