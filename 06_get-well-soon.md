## Chapter 6: Get well soon

Everyone thinks that there was a bioterrorist attack, possibly to protest the
conditions in the camp, but no one in the government cares about the camp. In
fact, if an attack were to wipe out the camp, the government would see it as a
net positive.

Zek, Zok, Ursa, and Iona arrive to visit Kaia and Sata at the infirmary.

An investigator asks Sata and Kaia about the bioterrorist attack.
Why did the girls have such different symptoms than the boys? The girls seemed
to be at the center of the blast and had only physical symptoms, while the boys
were all left with post traumatic stress disorder and seemed to be suffering
from purely psychological symptoms.

...


Dar visits Kaia and Sata in the infirmary and says how great the video of them
being chased by All Grays and then attacked by the boys was for the Rainbow
Sports Club brand, because they were wearing the Rainbow uniforms. "It's not a
problem that the boys who attacked you were not wearing all gray. All need to
do is apply a greyscale filter over there clothing and voilà!" He asks the
girls if they might be willing to do it again sometime, but then says the he
understands that they don't want to get beat up again. Kaia and Sata are
suspicious that Dar seems so happy about the video of them getting beat up. Dar
asks them to sign a contract for the rights to the images and videos of the
attack that will require for them to pose for new pictures and videos wearing
Rainbow scarves and hats. Sata tells Dar to that they're not interested. Iona
later brings up the contract and asks if Kaia and Sata want her to negotiate
with Dar for them. Kaia and Sata say that they will think about it.

Later, Pyr shows up in the infirmary to ask for forgiveness and for Kaia and
Sata to sign his casts. Fera was going to break Pyr's legs too, but she felt
bad for the person that would have to carry Pyr around. Kaia and Sata find out
that someone paid Pyr, his Posse, and the soccer hooligans to beat them up.
They immediately think it was Dar who paid their attackers. Iona tells them
about "Qui Bono" and says that Dar stands the most to gain from them being beat
up.

...

In the infirmary Ursa and Iona ask if Kaia wants them to beat up Pyr, but Kaia
says no. Sata says that they could at least give him a black eye, but Kaia says
that it wouldn't help them and that Pyr must be emotionally hurt because he
believes that his father died in the explosion.

Lan and Arla visit Kaia and Sata. They say that they are rehearsing for a dance
performance and a theater play. In their spare time, Lan works in the kitchen
and Arla spends time with Kransal.

Ben and Edl visit them to say that they will be able to watch the remembrance
ceremony on the infirmary tent walls and that he set up the projector and sound
system himself and the infirmary staff have been given special instructions and
compensation.

Kaia and Sata's parents visit them in the infirmary. Kaia's dad is a gruff man
with a big moustache. Kaia knows that her dad straightens his moustache and
then ruffles it to make it bushy. Sata's parents are good friends with Kaia's
parents.

Her parents ask if they are making new friends. They make a joke about getting
the wrong idea about Sata and Kaia, because they are always together and never
really had any boyfriends. "If you're not careful, people will think you're
lesbians!" Kaia and Sata laugh nervously. Kaia and Sata say that they made
friends in the performance group and maker workshop. Kaia's dad says that
performances don't really benefit society or provide anything of tangible value
and that maker culture is silly, because everything can be manufactured,
printed, or synthesized.

Kaia's dad lectures Kaia on the importance of standing up for herself.
Normally, Kaia would go to her room and listen to music, but Kaia can't leave
the infirmary bed, so she has to sit and listen to it. Kaia's dad says that
bullies are targeting Kaia because she is not projecting strength. "Don't close
your eyes while I'm talking to you!" Kaia's dad says that you have to puff your
chest out and keep your chin up. Kaia's mom says that it's better to carry a
big bag to protect your chest and keep your chin down to protect your neck and
not attract attention.

That evening Kaia and Sata watch the remembrance ceremony on the walls of the
infirmary tent. That night Kaia cannot sleep and she sees Fera. Not believing
her eyes, Kaia thinks she is dreaming or hallucinating.

Fera says that she broke both of Pyr's arms after finding out what he did to
Kaia and Sata. Kaia thinks that means that she broke both of Pyr's arms and
feel very sorry. She tells Sata that she broke Pyr's arms with her mind. Sata
says that she normally wouldn't believe it, but she is ready to believe
anything after seeing Zek's demo.

"I told you losers that I'm not dead."

"You could be a vengeful spirit that doesn't know its dead."

"I'm not dead!"

Fera says that she went to the remembrance ceremony in disguise and couldn't
help but laugh during Ben's heartfelt speech. "News of my demise have been
greatly exaggerated."

Kaia and Sata realize that Fera may actually be alive, because they remember a
person laughing during the speech. Fera says that she wants to keep the fact
that she's alive a secret until she can be sure that she is not wanted to
blowing up the city. Kaia tells Fera that they will be staying in the refugee
camp permanently, because the city is being rebuilt for new residents. Fera
gets angry, but says she is learning to control her anger. For example, she
says that barely enjoyed breaking Pyr's arms and that she almost felt sorry for
him afterwards. He seem relieved when I told him that his father is alive.

The Principal is alive? How did you survive the explosion?

The chapter ends with Fera beginning to tell them her story.

...

"I saw you on the ground when we were taking off. I tried to get them to go
back for you..."

"Ah, that was your airship? No worries, it worked out in the end."


"Ursa, I felt it. It's all true. All of it. Your dreams will come true too.
Kaia is the one we've been waiting for all this time."

"I haven't been waiting as long as you. My faith is not as strong as yours, Iona."

"It doesn't matter. She favors you. I can see it."

"Can I still be saved? After what I did?"

"Your sins are nothing compared to mine, but it does not matter whether we did
evil or we did good, because it was all necessary to bring us here. It all
happened as it was meant to happen."

"I want to believe that but I can't. I know that what I did was selfish. I hurt
the people closest to me to get what I wanted."

"You have suffered greatly to become part of her plan. We all have. We'll
suffer more before the rejoining can occur and the time of grace can arrive.
Our suffering is needed so we can become worthy of the salvation that she
offers. You were chosen because you were ready to sacrifice anything. You can
achieve everything you always wanted just by playing your role in the plan."


...

"Will our parents be down there?"

"Yes, everyone who was evacuated from the city will be "
called Zakrzówek. It i
...

Kaia sees the refugee camp from the observation deck soon after takeoff. "If we
were so close, why didn't we just parachute into the camp?" Ben explains that
the lake was the only place to crash land and the forest in between the lake
and camp was filled Driads and the city was patrolled by World Heritage robots.

...
There's a rivalry between the maker interest group (MIG) and the theater
interest group (TIG). The performance group makes fun of the makers for not having
any members. Ben says that they had as many as four members, but now they are
down to three and perhaps even two. Arla is upset to hear that Raf is still
unaccounted for. Kaia is devastated to find out that Fera was on the ground and
that her signal disappeared as she was trying to leave the city. She feels
angry at Sata and doesn't . Sata looks
very sorry, but doesn't know what to say to Kaia.

Kaia says she is upset that they have to leave so soon.

Ben explains that airship will not land but it can lift everyone up by a cable.
Zek and Zok start horsing around and the cables get tangled and everyone is
packed together in a mess. Ben flies up first and then helps everyone untangle.
Sata and Kaia are happy to be near each other in the bundle. Sata makes jokes.
Zek gets pressed up against Taz and Arla?


Everyone sits together except Taz, who is on duty.

Lan is upset to leave all of the supplies behind,
especially the food. Officer Kransal arranges for a smaller airship to the
refugee camp where all the other students are to meet. A refugee camp school is
repurposed and expanded to hold all of the new students in addition to the
original refugees that already lived in the camp. Lan decides to work in the
kitchen and uses his connections and swagger to get more food and other
supplies for the camp.

Kaia is ambushed by Pyr and his posse (who were secretly hired by Zek) in the
cafeteria. Edl goes to help Ben instead of Kaia. Ursa and Iona are not around.
Arla is with Kransal. Only Zek is around to save Kaia.

Zek takes Kaia to the hospital. Zek and Sata decide to stay with Kaia all
night.

"Just when I thought I was finally fitting in."

Fera, Raf, and Naksos arrive at the refugee camp. Pyr is reunited with his
father. Raf is reunited with Arla and Lan. Fera tells Kaia and Sata that she
has changed and is deeply sorry for how she behaved earlier.

Fera arm wrestles Iona, Ursa, and Edl, beating all of them.

"Laughing in people's faces after you win is a great way to make friends."

The chapter ends with a celebration in the refugee camp honoring the return of
Fera, Raf, and Naksos.
