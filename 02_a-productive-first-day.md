## Chapter 2: A productive first day

"Why am I like this?", Dela thought as she covered her mouth so no one would
hear her crying. She had been drifting in and out of sleep on the hard concrete
floor of the theater, but she could not stop thinking of Kaia writhing on the
ground during her psychotic episode. The screams were bad, but the low dull
wailing that followed was somehow worse. It was as if Kaia had a demon inside
her trying to claw its way out. Lita held onto Kaia the whole time, having
seizures one after another. During the seizures, Lita's eyes stayed open, the
look of concern on her face would melt away, she would stare off into void.
When Kaia stopped breathing, Lita responded immediately by giving her CPR. Did
Lita already know what to do, because she had been in this situation before?
Dela felt absolutely powerless. She had never known anyone like Lita and Kaia.
Was she responsible for what happened?

"It's not my fault that they're like that.", Dela thought to herself, getting
up off the ground and looking at Kaia and Lita lying peacefully in the secret
bed. Dela wanted to lay down in the secret bed next to them, it looked really
nice, but she was wracked by feelings of guilt and did not feel she deserved to
be comfortable.

"I don't need sleep. Beds are for the weak. The only thing that matters is the
revolution.", Dela thought as she got up and started trying to find her way out
of the theater in complete darkness. With each step, she probed the ground
beneath her. She hadn't gotten very far when she noticed two glowing eyes
observing her in the darkness.

"You know you're creepy as hell.", Dela said.

"Yes, I am aware of that. I am still learning how to interact with topsiders. My
sister is much better. She is a people person.", Ryn answered.

"Well, then bring her here. I'd rather talk to her."

"She is watching over Lita and Kaia. If they wake up in the darkness-"

"Shut up, turn on a flashlight, and show me the way out of here."

Ryn complied immediately. "Would you like to see the machine workshop?"

"Was he still trying to be friends with her?", Dela thought, "What a loser!".

Not having any other plan, Dela nodded. The machine workshop would be a welcome
distraction.

Arriving at the machine shop, Dela was dumbstruck at how technologically
advanced and well stocked it was.

"I was not expecting this place to be halfway decent. Everything else in the
crappy school is absolutely worthless."

"Ben and Ed's family finances the machine shop but do not provide funding for
any other part of the school."

"Who are Ben and Ed?"

"They are my friends. Ben is really smart. Ed is really big and strong."

Dela laughed. "And they have money to burn on all of this?"

"Their parents are high ranking members of the CorporateCouncil."

"If they're so rich, why do they go to a run-down public school?"

"I do not know.", Ryn said walking up to a console, "I ask them to come here so
you can ask."

It was no long before a thin boy wearing powerskates zipped into the machine
shop with another boy nearly as large as a guardGorilla running in after him.
him. The boy in power skates did a sliding stop right in front of Dela and Ryn
and the other boy ran up and stopped a few steps behind him. Reaching out one
hand to Dela and gesturing around the machine workshop with the other, "Welcome
to the machine shop!", the boy in power skates said. He was wearing metallic
gloves covered with intricate patterns.

Turning one begloved hand towards himself, "I'm Ben." and the other begloved
hand to boy behind him "and this is my little brother Ed.", bowing deeply "and
we are both deeply honored to be at your service."

"This is Dela.", Ryn said, "She likes making things too!"

"The gigaphone you built was impressive, considering the limited resources you
had at your disposal.", Ed said. "Just think of what you could build in the
machine workshop!"

"I can use all this stuff?", Dela asked.

"Yes, of course! Let me show you around." Ed replied.

"You can use any free workstation you like.", Ed said sweeping his hand across
the workshop, then turning towards a console, "You can also reserve any
workstation for any period of time,", holding up one finger on one hand, "but
you can only reserve one workstation at a time.".

"The reservation schedule looks mostly empty. Actually, you and Ryn are the
only ones making reservations. Do people mostly use whatever workstation is
available?

Ben looked a little uncomfortable. "The workshop is criminally underutilized.
The school does not require anyone to use it and it seems that making things is
not everyone's cup of tea. Also, there is a harmful stereotype that makers are
socially awkward nerds, but nothing could be further from the truth. I welcome
social interaction! In fact, I hold biweekly maker interest group (MIG)
meetings that are open to everyone. Despite my best efforts in promoting the
MIG, attendance remains limited."

"If you come to the meetings, we can have... four people!", Ed said looking
around the workshop, then showing four fingers on one hand.

"Maybe more people would show up if you made the meetings secret and exclusive.
People like being part of inside groups."

Ben stopped for a moment and began to scribble notes on his palm with his finger.

"That's brilliant!" Looking up from his palm, "Would you like to be the first
member of our newly formed secret maker interest group?"

"Sure.", Dela replied casually.

"Excellent!" Ben responded opening a large cabinet. "I just gave you full
access to the workshop. You can use any of the tools as long as you follow the
workshop rules."

"What are the rules?"

Ben brought up an image on the wall that said,
MACHINE WORKSHOP RULES
1. Do not intentionally kill, maim, or otherwise injury any sentient, living creature.

"Is there just one rule?"

"Yes, at least until we can agree on additional rules to add."

"What about stealing?"

"Every item has a tracker and everything in the entire school is recorded, so I
don't think that will be necessary. If a MIG member steals anything, we will
know and can revoke their access immediately."

"What about destruction of property?"

"Property can be replaced. Sometimes property gets destroyed during testing of
new inventions. I do not think protection of property should be a priority.
Again, if a MIG member acts maliciously, we can always revoke their access."

"What about school rules?"

"The MIG has full autonomy from the school. We are entirely self-governing."

"Sounds like you can do whatever you want."

"Well, yes, within reason. As the MIG Founder and President, I rarely exercise
my executive powers. We put most decisions to vote."

Dela took a moment to savor the idea of being able to do whatever she wanted.
Dela noticed a container labeled Ben's Builder Bots.

"You're building builder bots?"

"Yes, though I prefer to call it metabuilding.", Ben said pulling out the
container to show Dela.

Dela studied the contents of the container.
"Can the builder bots build builder bots?", she asked.

Ben opened his mouth to answer, but then starting scribbling furiously on his
palm while muttering to himself. "Builder bot building builder bots...
Self-replication... Metametabuilding... Why build when I can metabuild? Why
metabuild when I can metametabuild? Brilliant!"

Then looking up, "Would you like to be Vice President of the MIG?".

"You don't already have a Vice President?". Dela asked looking at Ryn and Ed.

"Ed and Ryn said they are both happy being Treasurer and Recordkeeper."

"I look at the money go in and out.", Ed said proudly.

"Look?"

"MIG financial management is completely automated and budget is practically
unlimited."

"What would I do as Vice President?"

"You would represent the MIG, and if the need arises when the President is
indisposed, you would exercise your executive powers."

"How would I exercise my executive powers?"

"Let's not get ahead of ourselves. First, we would have to vote you in a vice
president. Do you want to run? Even though you'll be running unopposed, we
still have to vote."

"Ok, sure." Dela said, trying her best to sound indifferent.

"Excellent, with all current members present, we have quorum. All those in
favor of Dela becoming Vice President of the MIG?"

Ryn, Ed, and Ben all raised their hands, said "Aye!", and then all looked at
Dela.

When Dela realized that they were waiting for her, she raised her hand and said
"Aye.".

"Alright, all opposed?" Ben asked, waiting for a few moments for anyone to
object.

Dela opened her mouth to say something, but decided against it.

"The vote is unanimous. Congratulations! We will hold elections at the end of
the school year. If you like you can run for President."

"You don't want to be President anymore?"

"Next year, I am going to be a senior and I believe it is time for me to start
preparing the next generation of MIG members."

"If you run for President next time, I will vote for you.", Ryn said.

"You have my vote too.", Ed added.

"Yes, I plan to vote for you as well. As the current Vice President and very
likely future President of the MIG, you should learn about our executive
powers. If something were to happen to me, you have to be ready to step in and
take over. Without the guardianship of the MIG, the school could descend into
chaos.", Ben said, walking over to a synthesizer and entering a complex series
of key presses and then laying his hands down on the screen.

I am making you a pair of gloves and skates that match my own. Ben said before
stopping, "Do you know how to skate?".

Dela nodded. Skating was Dela's refuge. All throughout middle school, she would
skate everyday until late in the night, skipping dinner and only coming home to
avoid sleeping on the street. Whenever she was home, she never felt safe. She
would sneak in after her parents were asleep and quietly crawl into bed.
Sometimes her father would wake up angry. Most of time, that anger would spill
over onto her mother, but sometimes her father would wake Dela up to yell at
her and hit her. There were a few times when he did not even wake Dela up and
just started hitting her while she was still in bed. If anyone asked about the
bruises that covered her body, Dela would say that fell down while skating. Even the mot

Question about Pert and the bird

Ben makes a matching set of powergloves for Dela. She puts on powerskates and
the new powergloves and Ben teaches her the ancient MakerMixedMartialArts
moves that he made up himself.

"How is it ancient if you made it up yourself?"

"Sorry, you're right. It just sounds better if martial arts are ancient."

Dela is impressed by the immense power that the gloves hold. She asks if there
are any failsafes.

Ben shows her how the gloves can be deactivated. Dela deactivates Ben's gloves
and asks if she did it right. Ben is impressed that Dela did it correctly on
her first try. He asks her to reactivate his gloves, but she deactivates all of
his security access and sends buzzBees to knock out Ben, Ed, and Ryn. Ed is
immune to the sedatives and chases her. She is amazed that he can keep up with
her and commands guardGorillas to slow him down. Dela heads to the Principal's
office to strongarm him into requesting a pardon. She stands on his desk and
holds an activated powerskate next to his face. The Principal vomits all the
skate short-circuiting it.

...

Placing one of her powerskates on his chest and leaning in as if she was
stretching her psoas muscle, Dela looked at the Principal menacingly.

"I want you a full pardon for me and the other girls."

"I don't haf that aufority!"

"Then you better find someone who does or I'm going to powerskate all over face
while the guardGorillas hold you down."

"Your bluffing."

"Are you sure? Take your time trying to figure it out, I'm not in a rush."

"A shtrike team hash already been dishpatched."

"Are they really going to charge in her just to save a buzzBee-addicted
Principal who lost control of school?"

The Principal cleared his throat, and said "I can requesht a pardon from the
E-" before vomiting all over Dela's leg.

Dela recoiled in horror, then she instinctively kicked the Principal in the
face, sending vomit flying in all directions.

"Request the pardon now!"

The Principal wiped his face with the sleeve of his blazer and started entering
the pardon requests as Dela stood over him making sure he did not try any
tricks. The pardon requests were approved soon after the Principal submitted
them. Dela hopped off the desk next to the Principal and read through each one
of the pardons.

"Great, but there's something else I want to do. I'm going to replace all of
the recordings of me and the other girls with fakes that show us all doing
really well in the initiation ceremony. I know I can't replace any local
copies that anyone downloaded, but with the digital watermark from console no
one will be able to say which version is the real one."

"While the fakes are being generated, let's see what else I can do"

"Fire alarm. Sprinklers. Deactivate all animalAutomatons. Self-destruct?"

"No, not the shelf-deshtruct!"

The self-destruct alarm alerts Ben, Ed, and Ryn, who find Dela outside the Principal's
office, having guardGorillas carry the Principal.

Ben and Ed try to force her to deactivate the school self-destruct system. Ed
wrestles guardGorillas, Ben uses powerskates and taser batons, but Ed leaves
when Ben is knocked unconscious. Dela faces off against Ben and Ed, Ryn
deactivates the lights trying to gain an advantage over Dela. Ryn stays to stop
Dela, she laughs at him for being a weakling, and when Kaia had guardGorillas
break a hole in the wall to get some light, Ryn summons birds to fight the
robotic animals. Dela is terrified but she finds
Ryn in the darkness by his glowing eyes and kicks him repeatedly in the face
with the vomit covered powerskate.



### Ryn and Dela

"The things you said earlier really hurt-"

"Shut up. I don't care. Just show me the way out."

Ryn drew in a big breathe. "I'm not going to help you until you apologize and
agree to be nicer to me."

"I'm not going to apologize!"

"Then fumble around in the darkness by yourself." Ryn said, turning around to
leave.

"Wait!" Dela said, "If you don't help me, I'm going to tell everyone about your
secret bed."

Ryn turned around, his eyes wide with shock.

"I'll also make sure everyone knows you sleep with your sister."

Ryn whimpered and started crying. The glow from his eyes
illuminated the tears rolling down his cheeks until they disappeared in the
darkness.

"Stop crying and get me out of here!"

Wiping his eyes, Ryn walked closer to Dela.

"What the hell are you doing?"

"I'm going to guide you to the exit."

"Hell no, just turn on the lights!"

"The light might wake up Kaia and Dela."

"Ok, then go get a flashlight."

"Aira has it and we only have one. She needs it in case Kaia and Dela-."

"How the hell are you planning to get me out of here?"

"I can guide you out if you just hold my hand."

"You're crazy, I'm not holding your hand. We're not in preschool."

"Are as you afraid of holding hands as you are afraid of the dark?"

"I'm not afraid of anything!"

"Then will you let me help you?"

"Fine, just get me out of here!"

Ryn's hand was suprisingly calloused and strong, his grip on Dela's hand was
gentle but firm. He walked slowly because Dela still felt uncertain about
walking in the dark.

"You hands are quite manly hands, considering you are such a wimp."

"It's from working on the theater sets. Aira and I build them all ourselves."

"Have you ever even held hands with a girl before? Other than your sister, of
course."

Ryn stopped for a second, "What is the significance of holding a girl's hand?",
he asked.

Dela laughed in his face or at least where she assumed his face was based on
the position of his eyes. She stopped laughing when she realized that Ryn was
being serious.

"You really don't know?!"

Ryn looked down in embarrassment.

"People hold hands when they're going out together."

"Yes, we are holding hands and we are going out of the theater together."

"No, I mean going out as in they're boyfriend and girlfriend."

"Are Kaia and Lita boyfriend and girlfriend?"

"No, they're both girls! Can't you tell?!"

"I can. I am just not sure about the words. People can be friends, but
sometimes when they say boyfriend and girlfriend, it means something
different."

"What do Lunkers say instead of boyfriend and girlfriend?"

"I think we say mate."

"Lunkers are weird."

"I think it is weird that topsiders say things that they know are not true or
say things to hurt each other on purpose."

"Are you talking about lies and insults?"

"Yes, those are the words."

"Do Lunkers always tell the truth and never insult each other?"

"If someone believes that telling lies can help others, then I can at least
understand the logic behind deception, even if I disagree, but I do not
understand the point of insults at all. I might say another to another Lunker
that I dislike the sound of their voice, but that is irrelevant. If I said to
another Lunker that their eyes glow dimly in the darkness, it would be out of
genuine concern for their wellbeing, not an insult. I think living in the darkness
helps us to build compassion."

"If you don't know how to lie, you are going to believe every lie you hear. If
you don't know how to insult someone, you won't know know how to defend
yourself."

Ryn was quiet for a while. Dela realized that they had been talking in the dark
for a long time.

"Keep walking.", Dela said shaking Ryn's hand to indicate urgency. Ryn complied.

"Can you teach me to lie to others and insult them?", Ryn asked shyly.

Dela laughed again, but this time with less malice.

"I'll only teach you if join the revolution."

"The revolution?"

"We're going to overthrow the government!"

"The government is not nice to Lunkers. They search our caves for precious
minerals with blindingly bright lights. If they find anything, we have to move
our settlements to avoid the drilling machines."

"In the new world we are going to build, there will be justice for everyone,
even Lunkers."

"If I can help people by joining your revolution, then I am happy to do so."

"I'm not sure what a wimp like you is going to be able to contribute, but maybe
you can at least be good cannon fodder."

"What is cannon fodder?"

"It's when expendable people are used to absorb enemy fire."

"I am starting to think you do not care much about others."

"I don't care what you think. Are we almost there yet? I feel like we are going
in circles."

"That is because we are going in circles."

"What?"

"I have been practicing deception to try to understand your motivations, elicit
sympathy in you, and to learn more about topsiders in general."

"You dirty moleman!", Dela screamed at Ryn, throwing his hand off to the side.

"Did you know that Lunkers do not consider the word 'moleman' to be an insult?
It sounds like molmin, a Lunker word meaning well-crafted or done with
purpose and skill."

"I don't care about your stupid language!"

"The word 'Lunker' was actually considered a slur until the government made it
the official name for our people."

"Nobody cares about Lunkers, because you are all pushovers!"

"If we try to resist the government, they release poisonous gas into our
tunnels. The gas burns our skin, especially our eyes. If anyone breathes it in,
they die. The gas poisons our food and water. Even with filter masks, we-"

"You all deserve to be gassed, you filthy Lunker molemen!"

Ryn covered his face with his hands as he started sobbing violently. With Ryn's
eyes closed, the darkness in front of Dela was complete.

"They all died." he whimpered, falling to the ground and shaking
uncontrollably. "Aira and I were the only ones who made it. The gas was
clogging the filters and everyone was suffocating. They gave us all their spare
filters and helped us get out even though they could not breathe. We left them
behind to save ourselves. I still see their melted faces whenever I close my
eyes."

Dela stood over Ryn with tears in her eyes. She was angry at Ryn for being so
weak and angry at herself for crying and wasting time on such a weakling. "If
Lunkers are so easy to kill, maybe they deserve it.", Dela thought. She wiped
her face and used the sound of crying to locate Ryn's head. She kicked out her
foot and was surprised at how solidly her shoe connect with the source of the
crying.

"Stop crying and get up!"

When Ryn kept crying, Dela was furious. She kicked him repeatedly until she was
gasping for breath from the exertion. Ryn was not making any sound whatsoever.
Dela dropped to her hands and knees, listening for breathing or any signs of
life.

"Are you concerned for my wellbeing?", Ryn asked, scaring Dela.

"No!", Dela replied, punching Ryn in one of the eyes he had just opened.

It was silent and dark for a while before Ryn spoke again.

"I am sorry for crying. I can still help you, but could you stop hurting me
please? If my eyes swell up more, I will not be able to see in the dark."

Dela stood up and gave Ryn another kick. "I will stop hurting you when stop
being such a weakling. Now get up!"

Ryn got up and shrunk away from Dela. The shape of his eyes were different.
"His eyes really are swollen.", Dela thought realizing that she had been
kicking Ryn in the face.

"Help me out of here or I will smash up your face so much we'll both be stuck
here."

This time Ryn did not delay in taking Dela to the exit. When they moved past
the last curtain. Dela looked Ryn who was shielding his eyes from the light.
His face was swollen and covered with bruises. Was he not defending himself at
all from her kicks? Ryn turned around to leave.

"Oh no, you're not off the hook yet.", Dela said.

Ryn froze, then turned around with a pitiful look on his face.

"Please, no more.", he mumbled.

"I need to destroy a taserTutor, actually burning down the entire gym down
will be better, and you're going to help me."

"No, I can't." Ryn pleaded.

"If you don't, I will tell everyone about your filthy, incestuous relationship
with your sister."

"No, it's not true."

"I'll help the bullies beat you and your sister into a pulp."

"Please no. Please don't hurt Aira." Ryn said crying.

"No crying!", Dela yelled slapping Ryn in the face, "Or I'll rip her apart and
make you watch."

Ryn bit his knuckle to bring himself under control.

"Ok, I'll do anything, but please don't hurt Aira.", his voice quivering.

"Get moving. We can't waste anymore time" Dela said shoving Ryn out the door of
the theater.

Outside the theater, Ryn took a long time to get used to bright lights. Dela
realized that both of their faces were covered with bruises and that they were
attracting the attention of nearby students.

"Come on, people are starting to stare at your stupid, swollen face."

"I am sorry my face is swollen."

"You've never looked better. Now move or I'll make a few more improvements."

"How are you going to burn down the gymnasium?"

"You mean, how are WE going to burn down the gym. WE are going to overload all
of the power cells in all of the robotic animals."

"But that will cause a huge explosion!"

"If we're lucky. Now keep your voice down or someone will hear us."

"There are people in the gymnasium. The ceremony is still ongoing."

"I don't care about them."

"I won't let anyone get hurt. What if we set off the fire alarm before the
explosion?"

"Sure, that's fine as long as the taserTutor is destroyed."

"Ok, but you mustn't tell anyone anything.", Ryn said.

When Dela nodded, Ryn led her down several hallways and up to a set of windows.

"Help me open all the windows.", Ryn said.

"You can kill yourself after we blow up the gym, not before."

"I don't want to kill myself. I just want to create a diversion."

"What?"

"Just help me it will be faster if we work together."

After opening all the windows, Dela grew impatient when nothing happened.

"What are we waiting for? Why are we wasting time just standing her?"

"Please wait.", Ryn said with eyes closed.

"What the hell are you doing? Snap out of it.", Dela said grabbing his
shoulders and shaking him.

"I'm creating a diversion."

"By standing next to a window with your eyes closed? Are you a lizard that
needs sit in the sun to stay warm? Are you making food from the sunlight like a
plant?"

"How did you know I can photosynthesize?", Ryn asked opening his eyes wide in
shock. When Ryn realized that Dela did not know that he could photosynthesize
until he gave it away, he got flustered.

"You mustn't tell anyone anything!", Ryn exclaimed.

"Fine! Just hurry it up with your diversion."

"Ok, it's ready. Now move away from window."

"First, we need to stand next to window and now we need to move away? What the
hell are you-"

Ryn grabbed Dela's hand, pulled her into a corner, and used his body to shield
her from the flood of birds that were flying in through the open windows.

When the birds passed, Ryn pulled Dela out of the corner and ran with her down
the hallway after the mass of birds. All through the hallways, robotic animals
fought with the birds. Ryn ran up to a door and placed his palms on the door
and brought his closer for a retina scan. They went through the open door and saw an empty room with a large table in the center. As the door closed behind them, the sounds of the chaotic battle in the hallway faded away and an automated voice greeted them.

"Welcome Principal Naksos.", the voice said.

"What?", Dela asked.

"I gave myself the Principal's fingerprints and retinas, so I could access
any system in the school. You mustn't tell anyone anything."

"That's actually kinda awesome.", Dela admitted.

"I will do anything to protect Aira.", Ryn said getting emotional again.

"Ok, I get it. Let's get this over with."

"I am going to unlock the control center. You start the fire alarm and I will
detonate the robotic animals after everyone is clear."

Ryn used his palms and eyes to activate the table. When Dela walked up to it, a
console appeared. She had administrative access to the entire school system.
Dela did not waste any time setting off the first alarm. Ryn was busy working
on the console. First, he had the taserTutor release the student currently
going through the ceremony. Then, he had the automated voice tell everyone to
evacuate. Finally, he had all of the robotic animals surround the taserTutor
before sending the command for them to detonate.

"It is done. We should go now."

"Not yet.", Dela replied.

"The taserTutor is destroyed, the gymnasium is buried in rubble. What are you
doing?"

"Shut up. You had all of this power and you didn't use it. You're an idiot!"

Ryn ran over to Dela and looked at what she was entering into the console.

"If you detonate all of the robotic animals, people could get hurt!"
Ryn tried to pull Dela away from the console, but he was swarmed with buzzBees.

"Don't hurt Aira." Ryn said as he succumbed to the buzzBee stings.

Turning back to the console, Dela finished detonating all of the remaining
robotic animals except a handful of wakeupWasps which she sent to revive Ryn.
As Ryn was waking up, Dela initiated the self-destruct sequence of the school
reactor, opened the door to the control room, and locked the control console.
An automated voice announced that they should evacuate the building. Dela
grabbed Ryn by the hand and yanked him outside. They ran through a charred
hallway filled with rubble, the remains of exploded robotic animals, and bodies
of dead birds. Ryn suddenly stopped and fell to his knees crying.

"Why are you stopping?"

"They're dead. You killed them."

"I didn't kill anyone. I made sure only to detonate the robots if there were no
people around."

Ryn gingerly picked up the burnt carcass of a dead bird and hugged it to his
chest as he cried.

"You mean the birds?!", Dela screamed. She suddenly felt filled with rage. She
started kicking Ryn as hard as she could. When Ryn fell over, Dela stopped
kicking and tried to pick him up, but he refused to stand up. Leaving Ryn
behind, Dela raced to the Principal's office and kicked down the door.






She thinks that no one would charge in now to try to deactivate the
self-destruct sequence, so Dela grabs the unconscious Ryn and the groggy
Principal and pulls them out of the school while balancing on only one
powerskate. Once outside the Principal purchases a motorcycle with a sidecar at
the microtransit vending machine and then after Dela brings the motorcycle
around the Principal lifts Ryn onto Dela's lap and they try to escape. In the
final moments, Dela reflects on Ben, Ed, Ryn, Aira, Lita, and Kaia, starting to
cry when she thought about how they might have been friends if things were
different. She thinks about feeling powerless to stop her abusive father and
substance dependent mother. As she is knocked off the motorcycle from behind
she imagines she is a bird flying off into the horizon.

...

When Dela made it outside with Ryn and the Principal in tow, they saw that the
evacuation team had already cleared the blast zone. Dela guided the Principal
to a microtransit vending machine.

"Unlock it!"

"What are-"

"If you don't, we're both going to die."

The Principal placed his palms on the machine and leaned in for the retinal
scan. Dela made a selection using the accompanying display, and a black
motocycle with a sidecar rolled up a ramp next to them. Dela ran to the
motorcycle.

"Wait, don't leaf me!" The Principal yelled reaching for Dela.

"What do you think the sidecar is for?", Dela answered as she started the
motorcycle.

Dela spun the motorcycle around and pulled up next to the Principal who fell
into the sidecar. Racing down the empty street, Dela tried to remember how much
time was left before she left the school. Dela did not know how far the blast
zone extended, but she knew that until she saw people, they wouldn't be safe.

"How big is blast zone?", she yelled at the Principal.
"To the treesh!", he yelled back.

"What?"

"We haf to make it to the treesh."

Dela did not know where the Principal was pointing, she had never seen trees in
the city. She was not going fast enough. Dela accelerated, but she knew that
they had no chance of making it in time. Dela thought about what had happened
that day. She had pushed back against the system and won. Even if only
succeeded in smashing just a single cog in the machine of oppression, it was
worth it. Reflecting on her life, Dela realized that for the first time in her
life, she had felt truly powerful. She was always powerless to stop her father
from beating her when he got angry. She could not do anything to keep her
mother from self-medicating her worries away. Being in control, even if it was
part of one day, was worth any cost for Dela. Even if she knew that she was
going to die, she would not have changed much about today. She just wished she
could have had a chance to apologize Kaia and Lita. Maybe if things were
different, they could've been friends? Dela's eyes filled with tears.

Dela thinks about Ben and Ed too, and the life she could have had working in
the machine workshop, maybe helping Aira and Ryn in the theater.

Dela strokes Ryn's hair and caresses his mangled face.

"It's the wind in my eyes." Dela thought, "No way I'm crying over those
losers."

Dela closed her eyes. It didn't matter now. She was free. She relaxed her body
and focused on her last few breaths. The blow from behind came sooner than Dela
expected. She thought she would hear the explosion first and maybe have a
chance to look back at the blast before it enveloped her. As she flew through
the air with her eyes closed, she stretched out her arms and imagined she was a
giant bird flying over the empty city towards an infinite sea of green on the
horizon.

Ben and Ed on one of their family's airships.

"I hope Dela made it out OK.", Ed asked.

"I am sure she did. Dela is extremely cunning. I have never before met someone
who I might consider my intellectual equal.", Ben asked. "No offense, Ed."

"Is Dela still going to be part of our group?", Ed asked.

"As far as I can tell, she did not do anything against the Machine workshop
rules. The city was safely evacuated and reconstruction has already begun. To
be frank, the MIG always felt incomplete when it was just you, me, and Ryn."

"I am glad that Dela is still in our group."

"Me too." Ben said, patting Ed's massive shoulder.

Ben receives a notification that Dela's powergloves were destroyed in the blast.

"Maybe she dropped them along the way?"

Ed is already crying at the thought of Dela dying.

Looking out the windows of the observation deck of their airship, the brothers,
both remembering Dela fondly, watched as the sunset behind the smoldering
remains of the city.
