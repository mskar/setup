## Chapter 2: A productive first day

"Why am I like this?", Fera thought as she covered her mouth so no one would
hear her crying. She had been drifting in and out of sleep on the hard concrete
floor of the theater, but she could not stop thinking of Kaia writhing on the
ground during her psychotic episode. The screams were bad, but the low dull
wailing that followed was somehow worse. It was as if Kaia had a demon inside
her trying to claw its way out. Sata held onto Kaia the whole time, having
seizures one after another. During the seizures, Sata's eyes stayed open, the
look of concern on her face would melt away, she would stare off into void.
When Kaia stopped breathing, Sata responded immediately by giving her CPR. Did
Sata already know what to do, because she had been in this situation before?
Fera felt absolutely powerless. She had never known anyone like Sata and Kaia.
Was she responsible for what happened?

"It's not my fault that they're like that.", Fera thought to herself, getting
up off the ground and looking at Kaia and Sata lying peacefully in the secret
bed. Fera wanted to lay down in the secret bed next to them, it looked really
nice, but she was wracked by feelings of guilt and did not feel she deserved to
be comfortable.

"I don't need sleep. Beds are for the weak. The only thing that matters is the
revolution.", Fera thought as she got up and started trying to find her way out
of the theater in complete darkness. With each step, she probed the ground
beneath her. She hadn't gotten very far when she noticed two glowing eyes
observing her in the darkness.

"You know you're creepy as hell.", Fera said.

"Yes, I am aware of that. I am still learning how to interact with Cacumens. My
sister is much better. She is a people person.", Ryn answered.

"Well, then bring her here. I'd rather talk to her."

"She is watching over Sata and Kaia. If they wake up in the darkness-"

"Shut up, turn on a flashlight, and show me the way out of here."

Ryn complied immediately. "Would you like to see the maker workshop?"

"Was he still trying to be friends with her?", Fera thought, "What a loser!".

Not having any other plan, Fera nodded. The maker workshop would be a welcome
distraction.

Arriving at the maker workshop, Fera was dumbstruck at how technologically
advanced and well stocked it was.

"I was not expecting this place to be halfway decent. Everything else in the
crappy school is absolutely worthless."

"Ben and Ed's family finances the maker workshop but do not provide funding for
any other part of the school."

"Who are Ben and Ed?"

"They are my friends. Ben is really smart. Ed is really big and strong."

Fera laughed. "And they have money to burn on all of this?"

"Their parents are high ranking members of the CorporateCouncil."

"If they're so rich, why do they go to a run-down public school?"

"I do not know.", Ryn said walking up to a console, "I ask them to come here so
you can ask."

It was no long before a thin boy wearing powerskates zipped into the maker
shop with another boy nearly as large as a guardGorilla running in after him.
him. The boy in power skates did a sliding stop right in front of Fera and Ryn
and the other boy ran up and stopped a few steps behind him. Reaching out one
hand to Fera and gesturing around the maker workshop with the other, "Welcome
to the maker shop!", the boy in power skates said. He was wearing metallic
gloves covered with intricate patterns.

Turning one begloved hand towards himself, "I'm Ben." and the other begloved
hand to boy behind him "and this is my little brother Ed.", bowing deeply "and
we are both deeply honored to be at your service."

"This is Fera.", Ryn said, "She likes making things too!"

"The gigaphone you built was impressive, considering the limited resources you
had at your disposal.", Ed said. "Just think of what you could build in the
maker workshop!"

"I can use all this stuff?", Fera asked.

"Yes, of course! Let me show you around." Ed replied.

"You can use any free workstation you like.", Ed said sweeping his hand across
the workshop, then turning towards a console, "You can also reserve any
workstation for any period of time,", holding up one finger on one hand, "but
you can only reserve one workstation at a time.".

"The reservation schedule looks mostly empty. Actually, you and Ryn are the
only ones making reservations. Do people mostly use whatever workstation is
available?

Ben looked a little uncomfortable. "The workshop is criminally underutilized.
The school does not require anyone to use it and it seems that making things is
not everyone's cup of tea. Also, there is a harmful stereotype that makers are
socially awkward nerds, but nothing could be further from the truth. I welcome
social interaction! In fact, I hold biweekly maker interest group (MIG)
meetings that are open to everyone. Despite my best efforts in promoting the
MIG, attendance remains limited."

"If you come to the meetings, we can have... four people!", Ed said looking
around the workshop, then showing four fingers on one hand.

"Maybe more people would show up if you made the meetings secret and exclusive.
People like being part of inside groups."

Ben stopped for a moment and began to scribble notes on his palm with his finger.

"That's brilliant!" Looking up from his palm, "Would you like to be the first
member of our newly formed secret maker interest group?"

"Sure.", Fera replied casually.

"Excellent!" Ben responded opening a large cabinet. "I just gave you full
access to the workshop. You can use any of the tools as long as you follow the
workshop rules."

"What are the rules?"

Ben brought up an image on the wall that said,
MACHINE WORKSHOP RULES
1. Do not intentionally kill, maim, or otherwise injury any sentient, living creature.

"Is there just one rule?"

"Yes, at least until we can agree on additional rules to add."

"What about stealing?"

"Every item has a tracker and everything in the entire school is recorded, so I
don't think that will be necessary. If a MIG member steals anything, we will
know and can revoke their access immediately."

"What about destruction of property?"

"Property can be replaced. Sometimes property gets destroyed during testing of
new inventions. I do not think protection of property should be a priority.
Again, if a MIG member acts maliciously, we can always revoke their access."

"What about school rules?"

"The MIG has full autonomy from the school. We are entirely self-governing."

"Sounds like you can do whatever you want."

"Well, yes, within reason. As the MIG Founder and President, I rarely exercise
my executive powers. We put most decisions to vote."

Fera took a moment to savor the idea of being able to do whatever she wanted.
Fera noticed a container labeled Ben's Builder Bots.

"You're building builder bots?"

"Yes, though I prefer to call it metabuilding.", Ben said pulling out the
container to show Fera.

Fera studied the contents of the container.
"Can the builder bots build builder bots?", she asked.

Ben opened his mouth to answer, but then starting scribbling furiously on his
palm while muttering to himself. "Builder bot building builder bots...
Self-replication... Metametabuilding... Why build when I can metabuild? Why
metabuild when I can metametabuild? Brilliant!"

Then looking up, "Would you like to be Vice President of the MIG?".

"You don't already have a Vice President?". Fera asked looking at Ryn and Ed.

"Ed and Ryn said they are both happy being Treasurer and Recordkeeper."

"I look at the money go in and out.", Ed said proudly.

"Look?"

"MIG financial management is completely automated and budget is practically
unlimited."

"What would I do as Vice President?"

"You would represent the MIG, and if the need arises when the President is
indisposed, you would exercise your executive powers."

"How would I exercise my executive powers?"

"Let's not get ahead of ourselves. First, we would have to vote you in a vice
president. Do you want to run? Even though you'll be running unopposed, we
still have to vote."

"Ok, sure." Fera said, trying her best to sound indifferent.

"Excellent, with all current members present, we have quorum. All those in
favor of Fera becoming Vice President of the MIG?"

Ryn, Ed, and Ben all raised their hands, said "Aye!", and then all looked at
Fera.

When Fera realized that they were waiting for her, she raised her hand and said
"Aye.".

"Alright, all opposed?" Ben asked, waiting for a few moments for anyone to
object.

Fera opened her mouth to say something, but decided against it.

"The vote is unanimous. Congratulations! We will hold elections at the end of
the school year. If you like you can run for President."

"You don't want to be President anymore?"

"Next year, I am going to be a senior and I believe it is time for me to start
preparing the next generation of MIG members."

"If you run for President next time, I will vote for you.", Ryn said.

"You have my vote too.", Ed added.

"Yes, I plan to vote for you as well. As the current Vice President and very
likely future President of the MIG, you should learn about our executive
powers. If something were to happen to me, you have to be ready to step in and
take over. Without the guardianship of the MIG, the school could descend into
chaos.", Ben said, walking over to a synthesizer and entering a complex series
of key presses and then laying his hands down on the screen.

"Take off your shoes, take a seat, and put your hands and feet into the scanner
please."

"What? Why?"

I am going to make you a pair of presidentialPowergloves and a pair of
presidentialPowerskates, like the ones I have, but I need have the exact scans
of your hands and feet."

Fera sat down in front of the synthesizer and slid her hands and into the
scanner.

"You do know how to skate, right?", Ben said suddenly, realizing he should have
asked earlier.

Fera nodded. Skating was Fera's refuge. She learn to build things by fixing and
upgrading her skates. All throughout middle school, she would skate everyday
until late in the night, skipping dinner and only coming home to avoid sleeping
on the street. The only time she felt safe at home, was when her father was
asleep. She would sneak in after her parents were asleep and quietly crawl into
bed. Sometimes her father would wake up angry. Most of time, that anger would
spill over onto her mother, but sometimes her father would wake Fera up to yell
at her and hit her. There were a few times when he did not even wake Fera up
and just started hitting her while she was still sleeping in bed. If anyone
asked about the bruises that covered her body, Fera would say that fell down
while skating. The truth was that skating was much safer than being at home.

"While the synthesizer is making your gloves and skates, I can show you how
they work.", Ben said, then noticing that Fera had not moved since she sat
down, "Er, the scanner is done. You can pull your hands and feet out now."

Fera engrossed in her thoughts, snapped out of it, retrieved her hands and feet
from the scanner, turning her attention to Ben.

"The skates provide a top-level security clearance, so you can go anywhere in
the school and the AnimalAutomatons will not try to stop you. To speed up,
press your big toe down, to slow down lift your big toe, but be careful if you
lift it to high, you will start going backwards. To turn very quickly, lower
one big toe and raise the other. To activate magnetism, curl all of your toes.
Magnetism is most useful for tight turns, but you can also skate on any wall
that has a high metal content, which is most of the walls in the school. Do you
have any questions?"

Fera shook her head.

The skates are really intuitive. I am sure you will get the hang of them
quickly. The gloves are a bit more complex. First of all, the gloves can open
any door and activate any console in the school, you just have to place a hand
on it. You can also control any AnimalAutomaton in the school. To provide a
command, speak clearly and use gestures. The gloves also accept commands in
sign language, but you can do almost everything with verbal commands.

"I know sign language.", Fera said.

Ben looked shocked.

"My mother was deaf for a long time before she got the implant. She taught me
sign language, because she said that I couldn't really know her without
learning her native language.", Fera explained.

In the mornings, while her father was still asleep, Fera and her mother spoke
in complete silence using sign language. Fera would have her bag packed, hours
before she needed to leave for school. If she heard her father waking up, Fera
would grab her bag and run out the door. The mornings when her father would
sleep in were the best, Fera would sign with her mother for as long as she
could. Her mother would tell her stories while Fera wolfed down food after
skipping dinner the day before. When her mother's stories would make Fera
laugh, Fera had to cover her mouth so that her laughter would not wake her
father.

"Fera, are you listening?"

Even though her mother took the brunt of the abuse, Fera was secretly jealous
of her mother. When her father would start yelling, her mother could deactivate
her implant and pretend she was still listening. Fera wished she could turn off
her hearing or at least turn off her memory. Fera would cover her ears, but she
couldn't close her ears the way she could close her eyes. Instead, she had to
absorb all of the yelling, often for many hours. Every horrible thing her
father said remained burned in her memory.

"Yes, sorry, you were saying."

"The gloves have a range of a few hundred meters and if you ever find yourself
further away than that, you should be able to close the distance quickly with
the skates. Each glove can also deliver a non-lethal electric shock, but the
shock requires direct contact and should only be used in emergencies, because
the shock drains the glove fuel cells. After delivering a shock, the gloves are
useless until they are recharged. The electric shocks are only for an
emergency, do you understand?"

When Fera first got her period, her mother showed her a hidden bag filled with
supplies and explained the emergency plan. If Fera's father ever tried to take
off Fera's clothes or took his clothes off in front of her, Fera was supposed to
yell as loud as she could, then while her mother distracted her father, Fera
was supposed to grab the hidden bag, run out the door, and never come back.

"Fera, maybe you want to sit down and take a break?"

"No, I don't need a break."

Fera saw that the synthesizer had finished.

"I'm ready to try out the gloves and skates."

"Ok, but let me know if need to rest for a bit."

"I'm fine.", Fera said sharply. She opened the lid of the synthesizer and put
on the skates and the gloves.

"Now, you'll want to take it slow for a-", Ben started.

Fera hop onto the skates and whizzed up to a guardGorilla watching over the
maker workshop and started signing at him furiously. The guardGorilla hopped
onto its hands and started to dance upside-down. Fera called three ChaseChimps
over and made them cannonball one by one onto the feet of the guardGorilla.
Ben, Ryn, and Ed looked in on in shock as the guardGorilla started to juggle
the ChaseChimps with its feet. Fera turned towards a wall and with a few signs
had a swarm of buzzBees and wakeupWasps hovering in front of her. She had the
swarm form different shapes in the air and then sent all of the robotic bugs
back to their nests.

"Ok, I think I'm getting the hang of this.", Fera said stopping right in front
of the three stunned boys.

"It appears you have a natural affinity to the skates and gloves. I believe you
are ready to begin learning the Ancient martial art of droneDancing."

"droneDancing?!"

"Yes, that's what it's called until we can agree on a better name.", Ben said
unfurling a worn scroll with hand-drawn images and intricate hand-written text.
This ancient scroll holds the long-forgotten secrets of the droneDancers of the
distant past.

Studying the scroll, Fera noticed something strange. "Ben, is that your name at the
bottom there?"

Ben looked embarrassed. "Yes, it is."

"Did you make droneDancing up?"

"No, it is a real martial art but I did invent it."

"How is it ancient if you invented it?"

"Sorry, you're right. It just sounds better if a martial art is ancient. I was
thinking that no one is going to care about a martial art developed by a
teenager."

"You might be right. Let me see that scroll." Fera said starting to take the
scroll from Ben.

"Be careful with that, it's ancient!", Ben said sharply.

Fera looked at him sternly.

"You're right. It is not ancient. I burnt the edges and then poured tea all
over it." Ben said, surrscendering the scroll to Fera.

Fera looked at the scroll intensely. "It's very convincing. If it weren't for
the signature, I might not have figured it out right away."

"You can send flying animalAutomatons into your opponents?" Fera asked.

"Yes, any animalAutomatons can be used, but birds have the right combination of
speed and mass."

"Did you make a bird hit Pert in the head?"

"Who is Pert?"

"A boy who was bullying me and two other girls."

"I've never used droneDancing against another student. Actually, I've never
used droneDancing against anyone. I've never had a sparing partner, so I've
only done the kata."

Fera used her gloves to summon two historianHummingbirds. "En garde.", She
said, looking menacingly at Ben.

"To be honest, I don't think you are ready for sparing. We should start with
some kata. Here, I can-"

Fera sent her two birds flying at Ben's head from two different angles. Ben
pivoted to avoid the birds, lost control of his skates, and landed on ground.
Fera had the birds land on Ben's chest.

"Do you yield?", she asked triumphantly.

"Yes, yes!", Ben said quickly. Fera helped him to his feet.

"Do you want to go again?", Fera asked innocently.

"No, no, I think that's enough for today. "

"Hold on, these gloves are extremely powerful. Is there some kind of fail safe?
Some limit to their power?"

"A fail safe? That's an interesting idea. The gloves are tailored to their
specific wearer, so they could not be used by anyone else."

"If you wanted to turn off someone else's gloves, would you be able to?", Fera asked.

Ben thought for a while. "Yes, I would need to access a console to deactivate a
pair of gloves."

"Can you show me?", Fera asked sweetly.

"Of course!", Ben said expertly gliding up to a console. "First, you need to find the user. Then you can see all of their permissions. For example, you have two pieces of linked equipment, the gloves and skates, workspace reservations right, and access to the entire maker workshop."

"Let me see." Fera said moving up to the console, "Do changes take effect right
away or do you have to confirm them?"

"They take effect immediately, so please be careful!"

"Did I do it right?"

"Yes, that's amazing. You deactivated my gloves and skates on the first try!"

"And if I pull up two users, I can transfer permissions between them?"

"Yes, that's correct. Just move the icons, just like that. I knew the interface I designed was intuitive, but I never thought anyone would be able to figure it out without an explanation. I guess my user interface design skills are better than I suspected.", Ben said proudly.

"Er, Fera, you seem be locking me out of the system. Could you please restore
my permissions? Also, I think we should discuss the permissions that you
enabled for yourself. This is still your first day in the MIG and as far as I
understand your first day in high school, so maybe we should take things one
step-"

"It's been a crazy first day so far." Fera said still tapping at the console.
"I made great new friends and found a place where I truly feel I belong. Thank
you for accepting me into your group and making me feel welcome." Fera said,
turning to face the boys.

Ben grabbed his chest overcome with emotion, almost falling off of his
deactivated powerskates. Ryn and Ed both held onto each other for support,
wiping tears from their eyes. All three boys looked at Fera with admiration and
affection. They were caught completely off guard by swarm of buzzBees Fera sent
after them. On her way out of the workshop, Fera commanded the chaseChimps and
the guardGorilla to keep the boys in the workshop.

Fera sped down the hallway towards the Principal's office, but she turned
around when she heard a fierce battle cry behind her. It was Ed, covered in
buzzBees, sprinting toward her. Fera started to command every animalAutomaton
in the hallway to attack Ed. Ed started to slow down as the animalAutomatons
began to pile on. Before going around the corner, Fera saw Ed under a mountain
of animalAutomatons, valiantly trying to fight them all off.

Fera burst into the Principal's office and commanded the animalAutomatons
inside to stand down.

"Here's what's going to happen, you sack of-", Fera stopped when she saw that
the Principal was sleeping in his usual position, head tilted back and mouth
opened.

Jumping on top of the desk, Fera kicked the Principal in his face until
he woke up. Placing her on his chest, lunging forward and leaning in as if were
stretching her psoas muscle, Fera looked at the Principal menacingly.

"I want a full pardon for me and the other girls."

The Principal looked back and forth between Fera and the powerskate on his
chest. Then, the Principal opened his mouth to speak, but instead vomited all
over Fera's powerskate.

Fera recoiled in horror, then she instinctively kicked the Principal in the
face repeatedly, sending specks of vomit flying in all directions.

"Get the pardons! For me, Kaia, and Sata."

"I don't haf that aufority!"

"Then you better find someone who does or I'm going to powerskate all over face
while the guardGorillas hold you down."

"Your bluffing."

"Are you sure? Take your time trying to figure it out, I'm not in a rush."

"A shtrike team hash already been dishpatched."

"Are they really going to charge in her just to save a buzzBee-addicted
Principal who lost control of school?"

The Principal cleared his throat, and said "I can requesht the pardonsh from the
eternalEnlightened."

"Request the pardons now! Do it now!"

The Principal wiped his face with the sleeve of his blazer and started entering
the pardon requests as Fera stood over him making sure he did not try any
tricks. The pardon requests were approved soon after the Principal submitted
them. Fera commmanded the guardGorillas to hold the Principal down before
hopping off the desk to read carefully through each one of the pardons.

"Great, but there's something else I want to do. I'm going to replace all of
the recordings of me and the other girls with fakes that show us all doing
really well in the initiation ceremony. I know I can't replace any local
copies that anyone downloaded, but with the digital watermark from console no
one will be able to say which version is the real one."

"While the fakes are being generated, let's see what else I can do at your console."

"Fire alarm. Sprinklers. Deactivate all animalAutomatons. Self-destruct?"

"No, not the shelf-deshtruct!"

Fera laughed as she started the school's self-destruct sequence. An automated
voice started to count down in reverse.

Fera had the guardGorillas carry the Principal out of the office. Fera nearly fell over over her way out of the office. The powerskate covered in the Principal's vomit was not working at all. When Fera
looked out into the hallway, she was surprised to see that it was completely
dark.

"I thought we were friends...", Ryn said, hiding in the darkness, "but you are not acting like a friend."

"What are you doing here, Ryn?"

"The things you said earlier really hurt-"

"Shut up. I don't care. Just turn the lights back on."

Ryn drew in a big breathe. "I'm not going to help you until you apologize and
agree to be nicer to me, and turn off the self-destruct sequence."

"I'm never going to apologize and I definitely won't turn off the self-destruct
sequence"

"Then fumble around in the darkness until the school explodes." Ryn said,
turning around to leave.

"Wait!" Fera said, "If you don't help me, I'm going to tell everyone about your
secret bed."

Ryn remained silent in the darkness.

"I'll also make sure everyone knows you sleep with your sister."

"If you don't, I will tell everyone about your filthy, incestuous relationship
with your sister."

"No, it's not true."

"I'll help the bullies beat you and your sister into a pulp."

Ryn whimpered and started crying. The glow from his eyes illuminated the tears
rolling down his cheeks until they disappeared in the darkness.

"You're so mean."

"Lunkers are weird."

"I think it is weird that Cacumens say things that they know are not true or
say things to hurt each other on purpose."

"Do Lunkers always tell the truth and never insult each other?"

"If someone believes that telling lies can help others, then I can at least
understand the logic behind deception, even if I disagree, but I do not
understand the point of insults at all. I might say another to another Lunker
that I dislike the sound of their voice, but that is irrelevant. If I said to
another Lunker that their eyes glow dimly in the darkness, it would be out of
genuine concern for their wellbeing, not an insult. I think living in the darkness
helps us to build compassion."

"If you don't know how to lie, you are going to believe every lie you hear. If
you don't know how to insult someone, you won't know know how to defend
yourself."

Ryn was quiet for a while. Fera realized that they had been talking in the dark
for a long time.

"Can you teach me to lie to others and insult them?", Ryn asked shyly.

Fera laughed.

"I'll only teach you if join the revolution."

"The revolution?"

"We're going to overthrow the government!"

"The government is not nice to Lunkers. They search our caves for precious
minerals with blindingly bright lights. If they find anything, we have to move
our settlements to avoid the drilling machines."

"In the new world we are going to build, there will be justice for everyone,
even Lunkers."

"If I can help people by joining your revolution, then I am happy to do so."

"I'm not sure what a wimp like you is going to be able to contribute, but maybe
you can at least be good cannon fodder."

"What is cannon fodder?"

"It's when expendable people are used to absorb enemy fire."

"I am starting to think you do not care much about others."

"And I'm starting to think you are stalling."

"That is because I am stalling."

"For what?"

"Ben and Ed are working on stopping the self-destruct command."

Light began to trickle into the hallway.

"You're not the only one with a plan."

"I had every nearby guardGorillas start punch holes into the walls."

Suddenly bathed in light, Ryn started to retreat.

Fera charged forward on her sole working powerskate. She saw Ryn's outline in
the shadows, she kicked out the vomit covered powerskate and was surprised at
how solidly her it connected. Fera kicked Ryn until he stopped moving. She then grabbed his arm and started to drag him down the hallway.

"Ben read your profile after we woke. He said that you have anger management
issues, just like your father."

"You dirty moleman! I'm nothing like my father!"
", Fera screamed at Ryn and began to kick him with the broken powerskate again.

"Did you know that Lunkers do not consider the word 'moleman' to be an insult?
It sounds like molmin, a Lunker word meaning well-crafted or done with
purpose and skill."

"I don't care about your stupid language!"

"The word 'Lunker' was actually considered a slur until the government made it
the official name for our people."

"Nobody cares about Lunkers, because you are all pushovers!"

"If we try to resist the government, they release poisonous gas into our
tunnels. The gas burns our skin, especially our eyes. If anyone breathes it in,
they die. The gas poisons our food and water. Even with filter masks, we-"

"You all deserve to be gassed, you filthy Lunker molemen!"

Ryn covered his face with his hands as he started sobbing violently. With Ryn's
eyes closed, the darkness in front of Fera was complete.

"They all died.", he whimpered, falling to the ground and shaking
uncontrollably. "Aira and I were the only ones who made it. The gas was
clogging the filters and everyone was suffocating. They gave us all their spare
filters and helped us get out even though they could not breathe. We left them
behind to save ourselves. I still see their melted faces whenever I close my
eyes."

Fera stood over Ryn with tears in her eyes. She was angry at Ryn for being so
weak and angry at herself for crying and wasting time on such a weakling. "If
Lunkers are so easy to kill, maybe they deserve it.", Fera thought.

Fera wiped her face and gave Ryn another kick.

"Stop crying and get up!"

When Ryn kept crying, Fera was furious. She kicked him repeatedly until she was
gasping for breath from the exertion. Ryn was not making any sound whatsoever.
Fera dropped to her hands and knees, listening for breathing or any signs of
life.

"Are you concerned for my wellbeing?", Ryn asked, scaring Fera.

"No!", Fera replied, punching Ryn in one of the eyes he had just opened.

Fera looked Ryn who was shielding his eyes from the light.
His face was swollen and covered with bruises. Was he not defending himself at
all from her kicks?

"Get moving. We can't waste anymore time."

"What are we waiting for? Why are we wasting time just standing her?"

"Please wait a moment.", Ryn said with eyes closed.

"What the hell are you doing? Snap out of it.", Fera said grabbing his
shoulders and shaking him.

"I'm creating a diversion."

"How? By growing roots? Are you making food from the sunlight like a
plant?"

"How did you know I can photosynthesize?", Ryn asked opening his eyes wide in
shock. When Ryn realized that Fera did not know that he could photosynthesize
until he gave it away, he got flustered.

"You mustn't tell anyone anything!", Ryn exclaimed.

The hallway suddenly filled with a birds.

...

Ben and Ed try to force her to deactivate the school self-destruct system. Ed
wrestles guardGorillas, Ben uses powerskates and taser batons, but Ed leaves
when Ben is knocked unconscious. Fera faces off against Ben and Ed, Ryn
deactivates the lights trying to gain an advantage over Fera. Ryn stays to stop
Fera, she laughs at him for being a weakling, and when Kaia had guardGorillas
break a hole in the wall to get some light, Ryn summons birds to fight the
robotic animals. Fera is terrified but she finds
Ryn in the darkness by his glowing eyes and kicks him repeatedly in the face
with the vomit covered powerskate.

...

She thinks that no one would charge in now to try to deactivate the
self-destruct sequence, so Fera grabs the unconscious Ryn and the groggy
Principal and pulls them out of the school while balancing on only one
powerskate. Once outside the Principal purchases a motorcycle with a sidecar at
the microtransit vending machine and then after Fera brings the motorcycle
around the Principal lifts Ryn onto Fera's lap and they try to escape. In the
final moments, Fera reflects on Ben, Ed, Ryn, Aira, Sata, and Kaia, starting to
cry when she thought about how they might have been friends if things were
different. She thinks about feeling powerless to stop her abusive father and
substance dependent mother. As she is knocked off the motorcycle from behind
she imagines she is a bird flying off into the horizon.

...

When Fera made it outside with Ryn and the Principal in tow, they saw that the
evacuation team had already cleared the blast zone. Fera guided the Principal
to a microtransit vending machine.

"Unlock it!"

"What are-"

"If you don't, we're both going to die."

The Principal placed his palms on the machine and leaned in for the retinal
scan. Fera made a selection using the accompanying display, and a black
motocycle with a sidecar rolled up a ramp next to them. Fera ran to the
motorcycle.

"Wait, don't leaf me!" The Principal yelled reaching for Fera.

"What do you think the sidecar is for?", Fera answered as she started the
motorcycle.

Fera spun the motorcycle around and pulled up next to the Principal who fell
into the sidecar. Racing down the empty street, Fera tried to remember how much
time was left before she left the school. Fera did not know how far the blast
zone extended, but she knew that until she saw people, they wouldn't be safe.

"How big is blast zone?", she yelled at the Principal.
"To the treesh!", he yelled back.

"What?"

"We haf to make it to the treesh."

Fera did not know where the Principal was pointing, she had never seen trees in
the city. She was not going fast enough. Fera accelerated, but she knew that
they had no chance of making it in time. Fera thought about what had happened
that day. She had pushed back against the system and won. Even if only
succeeded in smashing just a single cog in the machine of oppression, it was
worth it. Reflecting on her life, Fera realized that for the first time in her
life, she had felt truly powerful. She was always powerless to stop her father
from beating her when he got angry. She could not do anything to keep her
mother from self-medicating her worries away. Being in control, even if it was
part of one day, was worth any cost for Fera. Even if she knew that she was
going to die, she would not have changed much about today. She just wished she
could have had a chance to apologize Kaia and Sata. Maybe if things were
different, they could've been friends? Fera's eyes filled with tears.

Fera thinks about Ben and Ed too, and the life she could have had working in
the maker workshop, maybe helping Aira and Ryn in the theater.

Fera strokes Ryn's hair and caresses his mangled face.

"It's the wind in my eyes." Fera thought, "No way I'm crying over those
losers."

Fera closed her eyes. It didn't matter now. She was free. She relaxed her body
and focused on her last few breaths. The blow from behind came sooner than Fera
expected. She thought she would hear the explosion first and maybe have a
chance to look back at the blast before it enveloped her. As she flew through
the air with her eyes closed, she stretched out her arms and imagined she was a
giant bird flying over the empty city towards an infinite sea of green on the
horizon.

...

Ben and Ed on one of their family's airships.

"I hope Fera made it out OK.", Ed asked.

"I am sure she did. Fera is extremely cunning. I have never before met someone
who I might consider my intellectual equal.", Ben asked. "No offense, Ed."

"Is Fera still going to be part of our group?", Ed asked.

"As far as I can tell, she did not do anything against the maker workshop
rules. The city was safely evacuated and reconstruction has already begun. To
be frank, the MIG always felt incomplete when it was just you, me, and Ryn."

"I am glad that Fera is still in our group."

"Me too." Ben said, patting Ed's massive shoulder.

Ben receives a notification that Fera's powergloves were destroyed in the blast.

"Maybe she dropped them along the way?"

Ed is already crying at the thought of Fera dying.

Looking out the windows of the observation deck of their airship, the brothers,
both remembering Fera fondly, watched as the sunset behind the smoldering
remains of the city.
