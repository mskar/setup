Kaia and Sata's first day of high school turns into a disaster that propels
them from one strange situation to another as they get caught in a web of
conflicts left behind by ancient wars and foretold by a secret prophecy. Along
the way, they encounter a substance dependent high school principal, a rebel
determined to overthrow the government, a bully who may get a redemption arc at
some point, stagehand twins from a subterranean world, an actor who enjoys the
finer things in life, a soldier from the previously mentioned subterranean
world, a former spy / current actress, a stoic director, another pair of twins
(but this time not from a subterranean world), an ingenious inventor and his
brawny brother, a conniving sports club manager, hooligans, a warrior
reawakened after thousands of years in stasis, an artificial intelligence that
loves practical jokes, a scientist with a tentacle fetish, aliens constructed
using instructions from an intergalactic message, and many other colorful
characters.
