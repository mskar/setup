## Trunderstudy

"What's a trunderstudy?"

"A triple understudy. It is like a vice president. Or rather a vice vice vice
president.", Aira explained, counting on her fingers with each "vice". "If
something happens to the lead performer, the understudy, and the dunderstudy,
then I have to be ready to take over, so that the show can go on."

## Eiva's daughter

"Look at what she can do.", Eiva proudly gesturing towards her daughter.
Fera looked in amazement as the skeleton in front of them danced.

"She can move it with her mind? Did you know she could do that?", Fera asked.

"Throw a bone knife at my face."

"What? No!"

"Fine, aim at my stomach. If I can't block it, you can always stitch up me
afterwards, but I'm not in any danger, because you throw like a girl."

Fera's favorite activity other than skating was throwing rocks. Whenever she
was too tired to skate, she would spend hours throwing rocks at abandoned
buildings. Throwing rocks was an outlet for the anger that Fera felt.

"Come on! Let's see what that noodle arm can do. I bet you can't even reach
me!"

Fera did not need any further encouragement. She threw a bone knife straight at
Eiva's chest.

Eiva did not move a muscle, but the knife got knocked away in mid-air.

"I was the best sinistrae wielder during the war. Changing the paths of thrown
bone knives was my specialty. Too bad I couldn't deflect dextrae bullets."

## Mungs:

Intro two new characters named Dzaa and Daka. Aka is a Mung girl who needs
exoskeletons to move around on earth because she suffers from osteogeneza
imperfecta and her bones are brittle and weak after a lifetime in space. Dzaa
is a Mung girl who grew up on a spacecraft that was spinning wildly out of
control. After a lifetime of being exposed to extreme G forces, Dzaa became
extremely strong, the exact opposite of Aka. Dzaa falls for Edll, because he is
the only man she has seen who can rival her strength. Ben takes an interest in
Daka's exoskeleton, which she built herself in space (a throwback to his
earlier interest in Fera). The Mung people are named after the Mung beans that
they grow in space as a protein source for Earth. The Mungs consist of various
ethnicities that were driven into space when larger, more powerful neighbours
took over their land. Various stereotypes exist regarding Mungs, e.g. that they
use their babies to plug holes in their spacecraft. Mungs fight with prisoners
sent to space. The government does not recognize Mungs as a people. Mungs want
a sovereign nation. The government cracks down on any political activity and
indiscriminately destroyed Mung ships before but had stopped since the Mungs
learn to throw space rocks at Earth with great precision. Currently, there is a
stalemate.

Dzaa and Daka are sent to Earth to talk with Fera after the Mung people she her
success as CEO of Reli Corp and connect it to the recording of Fera's protest.

The girls plead with Fera to help the Mungs gain sovereignty from the government.

Fera tells that them after the revolution, there will be freedom for everyone,
even Mungs.

"and Lunkers." Ryn added cautiously.

"Yes, Lunkers and Mungs."

"What about Atlantans?"

"The fish people? Ok, sure they can have freedom and equality too."

"What about Arborists?"

"Yes, the tree people can also have freedom."

"What about-"

"Stop naming various ethnicities already! Look, everyone will get freedom and equality."

It is very important for Mungs to be a sovereign nation. We don't want end up like the Zeppelinomads.

Nomads that roamed the air in the their floating cities. To be honest, they
were a nuisance. They would hunt birds for food, hijack airships, and dump
their trash on the people below. Luckily, the government wiped them all out by
igniting all of their hydrogen and taking away all of their precious helium.

Arborists show up to ask Fera to promise that she will protect the trees,
Atlantans ask Fera to promise to respect the oceans. Fera agrees in exchange
for their promise to support the revolution.

A descendant of the Zeppelinomads approaches Fera asking for her help to rebuild
the Zeppelin civilization. Fera's advisors tell her not to because Zeppelinomads
were jerks.

"Why is there a downvote arrow on your head?"

Fera asks what the Zeppelinomads what he can bring to the revolution.
He says that he can control the air.

"What good are gusts of wind good for?"

"Well if you have sails, I can fill them with air on windless day."

Fera waited for additional benefits, but then realized that the list ended with
the first item.

"Ok, so you will be useful when we are on some kind of vehicle propelled by
wind."

"Yes, the obvious example is a sailboat, but land yachts also have sails.
There's also parasailing, paragliding, and windsurfing."

Fera asks him for a demonstration, but the
exposure to sinistrae makes the demo very unimpressive.

"I think I felt something, but honestly I am not sure."

"That's what SHE said!" Eiva broke out laughing, then stopped laughing when she
saw that no one else was laughing.

"You don't have that joke here?"

"Obviously not, what's so funny?"

"Well, here is a guy who started off really confident, tried really hard to
impress us with skills until he was red in the face, and we barely felt a
thing, and I said that's what SHE said." Eiva broke out laughing again.

"It honestly is really funny. Y'all just don't understand." Eiva said a bit offended.

"Ok, I have seen enough. How many soldiers do you have?"

"Soldiers?"

"Yes, how many soldiers can you contribute to the revolution?"

"Zeppelinomads were always peaceful. We only stole what we needed for our
floating cities."

"Ok, if you do not have any soldiers, what do you have? Workers? Inventors?
Farmers?"

"We never farmed because we were nomads and lived in floating cities, but we
raised on our own birds. There were workers and inventors in Zeppelin
civilization, but now I am the only left."

"Wait, you're the only left?"

"Yes, as far as I know."

"And your only talent is moving air around?"

"Yes, but I am sure that with time and training I could master the other elements as well."

"Ok, I think we may have a use for you. Your job is stand next to me and fan
me. I don't want you speak, just fan me silently while looking at me with
complete admiration. I don't want to know your name. I will just call you
fanboy."

"Where should I get the fan?"

"Show a little initiative and find the fan yourself, you little runt! Do you
think the bone queen should solve all of your problems? Get going before I fill
you with hydrogen and light you on fire!" Fera exploded, finally losing her
patience.

Fera later becomes the CorporateCouncil Chair and becomes the most popular
streamer in the DemocracticDelegation. She is exhausted from constant work
meetings and never-ending demands from her followers for more content. She
shares videos of Eiva and her baby girl along with videos of Kaia and her baby
boy. Fera's followers speculate that Kaia, Eiva, and Fera are in a polyam
(polyamorous) relationship. Kaia does not use social media so only finds out
when she talks to Lita via her son. Lita is jealous. She thinks that Kaia got
rid of her so that she could live with Eiva and Fera.

"We are the Arborists, we speak for the trees!"

Fera stations guards around the secret locations of the eternalEnlighted. If
the eternalEnlighted ever disobey her, the guards are instructed to destroy all
of the brain tanks. She grants sovereignty to the Atlantans, Arborists,
Mungs, and Lunkers, as she promised, and she forms two new branches of
government: a monarchy with her as the queen and a council with a
representative from the Atlantans, the Arborists, the Lunkers, and the Mungs.

Fera gives herself a permanent seat on the new council with veto power and puts
her fanboy on the Council as the Zeppeliner representative and uses him as her
puppet.

Ryn asks for a seat on the council for mimics. Ben virtually represents scenders,
because he still cannot obtain a body. Kaia is asked to represent Martians.
Figa represents Thelusians.

Fera controls all branches of government. She is the matriarchalMonarch, the
permanent queen of the entire government, and Eiva's daughter will be Queen
after her. Kaia's son is referred to as the dark prince, he has no claim to the
throne, because only women can be matriarchalMonarchs. Kaia has to keep her
son's powers a secret. The other 4 branches of government advise her. She has
veto power and final say over their decisions. Fera is Chair of the
CorporateCouncil and the most popular streamer in the DemocracticDelegation.
She is a permanent member of the electedEthnicities representing sinistrae.
Dextrae do no get representation in the government.

Fera is planning to invade Mars and recover it from the Thelusians. Having
complete control of Earth, she launches her assault on Mars.

The next books focus on Eiva's daughter and Kaia's son. Eiva's daughter is
training to be queen. Kaia's son is not as good at controlling sinistrae as
Eiva's daughter. He is jealous of his older "sister". He has no claim to the
throne. He still has dreams of Mars. His mother's dreams bleed over into his
dreams. He wants to bring back his father, his other mother, his mother's
friend, but he cannot since dextrae technology has been banned. He has to keep
his ability to control dextrae a secret. He is planning to destroy the current
world and bring back dekstrae.

When Kaia and Lita are reunited.

Kaia was apprehensive. She could not help be remember the last time she stood
over a peoplePrinter waiting for Lita to be brought back to life. Her son
assured her that this time would be different. He was printing a body for Lita
that was many years older than the body she had before so Kaia and Lita could
be the same age, like before. Kaia was braced for heartbreak. When the lid to
the personPrinter opened, she was already in tears. Lita got out the
personPrinter, Kaia was amazed with amazing she looked. Kaia searched Lita's
face for signs of hatred or resentment. What she saw in Lita's face prompted
Kaia to throw her arms around Lita and hug her. Lita hugged her back. Her smell
was the same as before. Her touch was electrifying. Kaia did not allow herself
to believe just yet.

Kaia asks a question that only Lita can answer. When Lita answers it correctly,
Kaia gasps and reaches out to touch Lita's face. "It's really you." Lita nods.
They are both crying. Kaia starts to explain. "The years without you. Every
night I dreamt of you." Lita placed a hand on either side of Kaia's face and
gazed deeply into her eyes as they widened with shock. Lita crashed her face in
Kaia's, kissing her deep. Kaia melted into Lita's strong yet soft hands. The
room exploded with colors. Had they never kissed before? Kaia realized that she
had never really kissed anyone before. Kaia broke from the kiss. She was
hyperventilating and her head was spinning. She held onto Lita, who looked at
her with an amused expression on her face.

"Was it that good? I wasn't expecting you get all googly eyed on me."

Kaia started to laugh. Lita was back after years living as in the scenderverse.
Her worries that things would be different were dispelled. The horrible
waiting, the terrible uncertainty, the crushing doubt, all of it faded away.
Kaia couldn't express what she was feeling.

"We should probably get going. We have a planet to reconquer." Kaia's son said,
uncomfortable with the intense display of affection.

Kaia had forgotten she was not alone with Lita. Kaia became annoyed and was no
longer willing to hide her emotions.

"I've waited years for this. I never asked any of you for anything, never
anything for myself. Get the hell out and leave us alone!"

Kaia's son was shocked.

"Sure, no problem. You're welcome for reuniting you with the love of your life
by the way. Now that I've accomplished the impossible, I'll just go and sit in
a dark room by myself."

Kaia pulled Lita by the hand towards the table, thinking they could chat and
catch up after years of separation. Lita pulled Kaia in, wrapping her arms
around her lower back and burying her head in Kaia's chest.

"These are bigger than I remember."

Kaia struggled to catch her breath. Her heart was pounding. She felt like she
had been running for hours. Lita grabbed Kaia's hands and rested them on her
shoulders. Then grabbing the backs of Kaia's thighs, Lita lifted Kaia up with
ease and gently sat her down on the table.

"Were did you learn these moves?"

"I've been planning this for years and I watched a lot of naughty videos while
I was waiting for you to make me a new body."

Kaia laughed. "Are you planning to do something naughty to me?"

"I honestly wouldn't even know where to begin.", Lita admitted, "I was a virgin
before I died and I didn't even have a body in the scenderverse, much less a love life."

"I'm still a virgin too.", Kaia said bashfully.

"Shut up! How can you be a virgin when you have a kid?", Lita said, putting her hands on her hips.

"No, it's true! Zek did-"

"I remember. You told me before. I was just teasing you."


No one can carry a cellphone because during the war cellphone's could be caused
to detonate spontaneously. Kaia later learns to detonate anything with a fuel
cell, e.g. powerskates, powergloves, energy weapons, airships, etc. Kaia has a
dream that she is the mummy queen crawling through the airship. She finds the
airship fuel cells and destroys them. When Kaia wakes up the fuel cells have
actually been destroyed. The airship crashes into Zakrzówek quarry lake.

Bring in a Relic character to be a romantic partner for Dela. The silos are
all connected. The AI explains that there is a survivor from the war between
sinistrae and dekstrae intact in stasis. The AI explains that Eiva is pregnant
and she was selected to be the first person to be awakened as part of the plan
to bring about the resurgence of sinistrae. The AI tells Fera that she should
awaken Eiva and start introducing her to the new world and meanwhile Eiva will
teach Fera how to use sinistrae powers. When Eiva awakens she admits that Eiva
was not originally her name, but the AI said that she would pick a new name for
her that matched the time when she was awakened. Eiva's husband died trying to
protect the silos and keep them hidden. The AI does not try to create a full
name for Eiva and instead suggests that she add Fera's mother's name and Fera's
maternal grandmother's name (Eivavikadela Fridzia) and pretend she is Fera's sister.

Eiva and Fera develop a relationship and start sleeping together.

"After being frozen for thousands of years, I thought you might be a bit... frigid."

Eiva tackled Fera and started to throttle her.

"Oh, how did you know that's what I'm into?", Dela said, laughing.

Ryn discovers them. "You are together with Eiva?!" Then, a mischievous look
overtook Ryn's face. "Remember when you accused me of sleeping with my sister?
Turns out that you're an incestuous hypocrite."

Eiva looked puzzled.

"You're going to pay for that, you filthy moleman!"

Fera thinks that Eiva was lying to her about being pregnant. Eiva says she did
not know she was pregnant. She did not know it was possible for an embryo to
survive stasis. "When the baby is born, will our relationship change?", Fera
asked nervously.

Eiva's baby is a girl. Kaia's baby is a boy.

In the game that Keia and Edl play after they are sent home from school, Keia is
a thief and Edl is a knight. He constantly lets her get all of the power-ups and

Lost civilizations:
- Mimics: Government/Corporate scientists did not decode all of the information they received via intergalactic broadcasts. The information on Mimic culture and philosophy were not deemed important enough to spend time decoding. The fragments that the Mimics were able to piece together became the basis of Mimic culture on Earth. The Mimics want to find the remaining information to learn the purpose of their existence and the story behind the intergalactic broadcasts that carried the recipe for their creation.
- Martians: Martian civilization ended in a war with Thelusians, a space dwelling civilization that replaced most people with androids. The space settlements started to orbit Mars and eventually all crashed into the surface of Mars. The remnants of Martian civilization and the Thelusian civilization are both still on the surface of Mars. Corporations from Earth have to fight with Thelusians for territory to mine resources from Mars. Martians are thought to have died out.
- Thelusians:
- Sinistrae:
