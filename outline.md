  - Fera blows up the school
  - End: Fera, Ryn, and Mel appear to die

In the final moments, Fera reflects on Ben, Edl, Ryn, Aira, Sata, and Kaia,
starting to cry when she thought about how they might have been friends if
things were different. She thinks about feeling powerless to stop her abusive
father and substance dependent mother. As she is knocked off the motorcycle
from behind she imagines she is a bird flying off into the horizon.

- 03: A beautiful view:

Kaia, Sata, and Aira leave the school, meet Lan and Taz, evacuate in an
airship, crash by Zakrz√≥wek lake, make camp, Kaia and Ursa bath and bond

End: Kaia and Sata watch the airship wreckage together while holding hands.

- 04: Finally fitting in

Kaia asks Iona about medical training and the defibrillator she used. Everyone
is surprised. Iona says that has had no medical training apart from CPR and
that she never used a defibrillator. Everyone thinks that Kaia was imagining it.

Lan shares his backstory with Kaia when she sees
him crying after working in the kitchen? How does Kaia meet Ben and Edl? Kaia, Sata, Lan,
Aira, Zek, Zok, Ursa, Iona, and Taz settle into the refugee camp. Kaia gets
confirmation from Ben and Edl that Fera did not make it. Each protagonist has a
job/activity, e.g. Lan works in the kitchen and Taz guards the camp, Aira works
on stage (she misses Ryn), Ursa and Zok rehearse, Iona directs and goes over
the script with Zek, Edl plays bugBall, Ben tinkers, the performance group puts a
show. Kaia convinces Ursa and her understudy and dunderstudy to pretend to be
sick. To prevent any questions, they tell everyone that all three were kissing
each other. Aira was not invited to the kissing party, because she is with Taz.
Aira performs in front of Taz and the entire refugee camp and is extremely
moved by how well the show goes. She thanks Kaia and Ursa. Kaia gets beat up by
Pyr and his posse. Everyone visits Kaia in the hospital. Zek, Zok, Ursa, Iona,
and Sata stay with Kaia all night in the hospital. Kaia goes to sleep with Sata
stroking her hair and holding her hand.

- 05: Never looked better:


Fera and Ryn go to the Driads to ask for help with Mel. They spend the
night. Fera feels very cold. The Driad do not use fire. She did not eat
much of the food and now is hungry. Ryn hugs her to keep her warm. Fera
complains but secretly enjoys physical contact with Ryn. They arrive at the
Lunker city. They meet Nil and Oil. Fera thinks the boat ride is a trap, but
decides to go anyway. Nil and Oil act as tour guides. Fera enjoys the boat ride
with Ryn, even though she does not want to admit it. The boat is pulled between
the two sides of the lake by a rope. The water level drops until the boat is on
the bottom of a ravine. A door opens. The air that rushes out seems to make Ryn
sick. His body abandons preparation for pregnancy causing him to bleed from his
crotch. His skin turned pitch black, his feet sprouted roots and membranes out
under his arm and in between his legs and fingers. Fera drags Ryn away, but
feels powerless to help him. Fera looked up. Climbing out of the pit would take
a long time. She decided to go through the door. Whatever made Ryn sick came
from inside there. Maybe there was some clue inside? Fera took a deep breath
and drew an arrow. Holding her bow up with nocked arrow at ready, Fera passed
through the door.

...

Once inside, Fera encounters the AI. The AI explains sinistrae and introduces
Fera to Eiva. Eiva vomits out the stasis liquid and goes through a wash cycle
like in Austin Powers. Eiva and Fera immediately hit it off. "Why do you talk
so weird?" "I did not learn your language naturally. The AI remodeled the
language center of my brain while I was in stasis. I have a terrible headache
and I hate how stupid your language sounds. I don't care if it sounds weird to
you. The only thing that matters is that you can understand me." "I like the
way you sound. It's different, but I like it." The AI asks Eiva if Fera is an
acceptable candidate. Eiva says that Fera's abilities were demonstrated when
she blew up the city, but she wants to test Fera herself. Eiva hands a pair of
bone knives to Fera and tells her to defend herself. Fera is amazed at how fast
Eiva is able to move. Eiva says that she feels like she is moving through
molasses after being in stasis for so long. "What's molasses?" "Stop it, you're
making me feel old." "You look pretty good for your age." Fera realizes that
Eiva is aiming for her knife. "You're holding back." "Stop talking and fight."
Fera throws both of her bone knives at Eiva and rushes Eiva with the wooden
knives she has at her belt. Eiva deflect the thrown knives easily, but her feet
slid on the dust on the floor. Eiva laughed. "You almost ran into my knives.
Were you trying to get stabbed?" "I knew you were holding back and not at your
best. You might have been able to stab me but I have two knives to your throat.
Did I pass your little test?" "Yeah, you can get off me now." "What's the rush?
I kinda like being on top of you." "Drop those the knives and we'll see how
long you stay on top." Eiva said tossing her knives away. Fera did the same and
looked at Eiva defiantly. "Bring it!" Eiva grabbed Fera's shirt, bridged, and
rolled Fera off her with ease. Fera landed on her back and looked up at Eiva
with admiration. "The view from the bottom is not bad either." Eiva laughed.
"Can you teach me how to do that?" "Only if you dedicate yourself to leading
the resurgence." "Why can't you lead?" "I know nothing about your time. My
mission is prepare you to lead and then follow you." "So, you'll have to do
anything I say." Fera asked putting her hands on Eiva's hips. Eiva laughed. She
looked annoyed but did not move Fera's hands. "You'll have to earn the right to
lead. I can train you, but once we start, you can't back out. If you try to go
back to how your life was before, I'll have to kill you to preserve our
secrets." Eiva said gripping Fera's shirt menacingly.

"So you want me to overthrow the government? What are you going to put in its place?"

"That's up to you. I know nothing of your time."

"So after you train me, I get to call the shots."

"Yes, you'll be in charge as long as you don't do anything to betray the cause."

"All of this seems too good to be true. How do I know you are not trying to trick me?"

"How do you feel?"

"I feel good, but maybe its just that I like having you on top of me."

Eiva laughed, got up off Fera, and helped her up. "Does it feel like this was
meant to be? The AI selected you to lead the resurgence. You're the first
candidate ever, after thousands of years. If you don't want to lead, you can go
back to your life as it was and I'll go back to stasis. Is that what you want?"

"No," Fera said.

"Are you sure?" Eiva leaned in.

"Yes, I am."

"That's a relief. I'm glad you passed the test. If you hadn't agreed to lead, I
would've had to kill you and try to figure out your world on my own."

"You said I could back to my life."

"The first lesson in your training is 'Don't believe everything you hear'. From
the moment you found the capsule, you knew too much to go back to your previous
life."

"The first lesson is that I shouldn't trust anyone?"

"No, think about what people are saying. Does it makes sense for me to just let
you go and hop back in the stasis pod? Now that you found the capsule, others
can too. If I let you go, you could lead them here. If I were in stasis, I
would be defenseless. We have only one chance to bring about the resurgence and
this is it."

"One chance is all we'll need," Fera said narrowing her eyes and raising a
clenched fist.

"Good, the first mission is reconnaissance. Do you have any allies that could
help us with the resurgence?"

"Allies?" Fera realized she forgot about Ryn. "There's Ryn. He's outside. He's
sick."

"He got sick as soon as you opened the door?"
Fera nodded.

"His body must be dependent on dextrae for survival."

"What?"

"I'll explain once we help him. Come on."

Eiva grabbed Fera by the hand and lead her to cabinet.

"Before we go, we need equipment. These are skinScabbards. Put they go on your
forearms and shins."

"Are these made of skin?"

"Yes, they have bone knives inside. There's a flap by the hilt of each knife.
You'll have 8 knives on each forearm and 12 knives on each leg."

"40 knives?! Do think that will be enough?"

"We can always make more bone knives from fallen comrades and enemies."

Fera laughed but then realized that Eiva was not joking.

When they got outside.

"Don't touch him. Don't even go near him. Tell him to get in the boat."

"What? Why?"

"If you get near him, he will get worse. Unia will refill the lake. Then we can pull him in with the rope."

"So we're not getting in the boat with Ryn?"

"No, being near us could kill him. Tell him to get in the boat. If he doesn't, he's going to die."

"Ryn, can you hear me?"

Ryn moaned. His eyes were half closed.

"Ryn, you need to go back to the boat."

"Maybe we should leave him. He doesn't look like he would be a useful comrade anyway."

"He can be useful. He saved my life."

"Does he float? Maybe he doesn't need to be in the boat?"

"Ryn, listen to me. If you die here, Aira will left all alone."

Ryn's eyes opened wider.

"If you don't make it out of here, your parents will have died for nothing."

Ryn sobbed and rolled over on his stomach, ripping out the roots that connected
his feet with the ground.

"If you don't get on that boat, I'm going to find Aira and tell her that you
gave up on her. She'll know that your parents' sacrifice didn't mean anything
to you."

Ryn started crawling, but stopped and threw up onto the ground in front of him.

"If you don't keep moving, I swear I'll kill her, Ryn! I'll tell her you gave
up and then she's going to die knowing that you didn't care enough about her to try."

Ryn crawled through his own vomit up to the boat.

"If you don't get in that boat, she's as good as dead, Ryn. You know I'll do
it. You know me. I won't hesitate. I'll enjoy it."

Ryn brought himself up just barely enough to roll into the boat and hit the
floor like a bag of potatoes.

Eiva started to clap. "Well done. Looks like we picked the right person to lead
the resurgence. Now let's start climbing or we're going to get wet."

...

"I will transfer command to you after you can best me in
grappling, archery, and knife combat." "I already beat you in knife combat."
Eiva laughed again. "Your training hasn't even started yet." "When do we
start?" "First, we need to do some." Fera forgets about Ryn.
Fera and Eiva climb out using the rope connected to the boat then use the rope
to lift Ryn out. Fera is suprised that she can climb so well. She thinks Ryn is
extremely light, but the truth is she has become extremely strong. The AI
closes the lake to visitors and only gives Fera and Eiva access. On the train
to the refugee camp, Fera is angered when Ryn continues to cry over losing the
pregnancy and feeling sick in the presence of Fera and Eiva. Fera and Eiva move
away from Ryn. They snuggle up together. Fera says she feels weird sleeping
next to Eiva. Eiva tells her to shut up and enjoy it, which Fera does.

"What the hell is this romantic subplot nonsense?"

"Why do you say subplot? Our romance could be the main plot. The revolution has
waited for thousands of years. It can wait a few more years while you show me
around the modern world."

"Can we do both? People are suffering. I want our lives to be a trashy 'Girls'
Love' novel, but we need to make an impact."

"I knew I picked the right person to lead the resurgence."

"They're calling you the Bone Queen."

"I don't like it. Have them call me something else."

"Skeleton Queen?"

"That's even worse. Any other ideas?"

"Reine des os, but that's Queen of Bones, not Bone Queen."

"Ren Dezo? I like how that sounds! That's Ancient French, right?"

"Yes, but we just called it French. It would be great if you could too. You're
making me feel ancient."

"What would it be in Latin?"

"Regina Ossa."

"That's it. Let's go with Queen Ossa."

- 06: A great way to make friends

"Kaia! Who did this to you?"

"Fera! You're alive!" Kaia began to cry. Hard.

"What's with the waterworks?" Fera asked and waited for Kaia to calm down.

"I saw you on the ground when we were taking off. I tried to get them to go
back for you..."

"Ah, that was your airship? No worries, it worked out in the end."

Eiva, Fera, and Ryn arrive and visit Kaia in the hospital. Fera finds Pyr to
take revenge, she tells him that his father is alive, but then breaks his
arms and legs and tells him not to mess with Kaia ever again. Pyr winds up in
the hospital bed next to Kaia. He apologizes to Kaia and says that he was
paid by someone to beat up Kaia, but he does not know who it was. Fera beats
everyone in arm wrestling. Ryn asks Ben for help with inoculating against
sinistrae. Ben and Ryn begin to study the sinistrae injections that Eiva and
Fera brought. Taz tries an injection, notices that it messes with equipment,
but starts taking the injections when off duty as part of a tech detox, he
feels incredibly strong, energetic, virile. Taz has sex with Aira but Aira
gets sick from his use of the sinistrae injections, she convinces him to
stop. He agrees to stop for the good of the baby. Aira and Taz fall asleep
together. Aira is kidnapped in her sleep. Taz interrogates her. She doesn't
admit that she is a mimic. Taz injects her with the sinistrae and recoils in
horror as her skin turns pitch black, she grows membranes, and her feet
sprout roots. Lan is abducted from the kitchen. The government shows up in
Ben's workshop but he saves Ryn by giving him an empty injection. Kaia talks
with Taz and he is indifferent about Aira saying she lied to him. He refuses
to help rescue Aira. He hates being in uniform and uses sinistrae injections
when off duty. Taz snitches on the protagonists and they have to escape the
refugee camp. Ben, Edl, Zek, Zok, Ursa, Iona, Fera, Eiva, Kaia, Sata, and Ryn
plan to rescue Aira and Sata.

Kaia is moved to the infirmary of an airship that the protagonists are taking
to the site where Aira and Lan are being held. Kaia and Sata sleep next to
each other. Kaia is still hurt. The chapter ending contrasts Fera and Eiva
with Kaia and Sata. In combat, Fera and Eiva are fighters, while Kaia and
Sata play support roles. Sata likes light-hearted humor that may be a bit
naughty, while Fera likes brutal, offensive, lewd humor. Sata gets really
into jokes, Kaia plays more of a supportive role. No one understands Eiva's
humor because she is a relic. Fera and Eiva do not care about the feelings
and the well being of others. Kaia and Sata are more delicate, empathic, and
conscientious.

- 07: A touching reunion

The protagonists infiltrate the government facility. They move in stealthily,
Sata helps Kaia walk, because Kaia is still hurt. The protagonists are bathed
in spotlights and surrounded by heavily armed soldiers. They surrender and are
shocked into submission but when Kaia sees Sata being shocked and is shocked
herself, she has a vision of the Dust Queen and destroys all of the soldiers'
weapons and powersuits killing them all. Everyone is impressed with Kaia's
power, but Kaia is horrified by what she did. Ben is scientifically interested
in Kaia's power. Eiva says that Kaia's power would have changed the outcome of
the dextrae-sinistrae war. As they search for Lan and Aira, they are attacked
by GES. Kaia blinds the GES but they find their opponents with echolocation and
use screams to incapacitate anyone within range. When they scream, they cannot
use echolocation, because they have to close their sensitive ears. Kaia, Sata,
and Ryn find a child covered in blood who looks exactly like Lan. They find
Lan's body and see that Lan recently gave birth to the child who is a mimic
warrior. Lan had been starved for a long time, his skin was black, his
membranes was extended to catch the light, and his feet had sprouted roots. Lan
had been partially eaten by the mimic child. The blood covering the child was
Lan's. Ryn says that it should be impossible for Lan to produce a mimic warrior
in such a short time and that the child is because of government experiments.
The child looks exactly like a childlike mix of Lan and Zok. They take the
child with them, but Ryn tells them not to become attached to the child because
it only lived to kill. Mimic warriors are genderless and cannot reproduce. The
child would never learn to speak or develop intelligence and therefore they
should not give it a name (Does the nameless child develop intelligence and
learn to speak? Does it become a non-binary character? Anything is possible
right? Maybe with tech the mimic warrior can become intelligent. Does the mimic
warrior develop into a hermaphrodite parasite thanks to the messages sent by
distant mimic civilizations? Does it slaughter everyone in refugee camp? No,
the mimic child becomes a conduit for the nearby nascent mimic civilization.
More on this later). Their hidden airship is destroyed by an airstrike and the
base is surrounded by giant robots. A soldier with a gigaphone tells them
surrender or they will destroy the base with airstrikes. Everyone tries to
convince Kaia to use her power, but she does not want to kill anyone else. She
is still shocked by the fact that Aira and Lan are dead. Fera finds an intact
stunStaff and shocks Kaia. The stunStaff malfunctions from Fera's sinistrae.
Sata tries to stop Fera. The protagonists fight. The sinistrae are evenly
matched against the dextrae, because Zek cannot blind them and the sinistrae
sap the strength of Zok, Ursa, and Iona. Ursa and Zok are not able to wield
energy effectively. The blows they land are absorbed by the bone armor that
Eiva and Fera wear. Zek tries to land a blow with his knives and snakes, but
Eiva and Fera are stronger and faster. While everyone is distracted, Ben uses
another stunStaff on Kaia and studies her response. Edl holds Sata and Ryn
back, because Ben told him to do so. Sata cries as Kaia is shocked repeatedly.
The stunStaff explodes, blowing off Ben's hand. Kaia, as the Dust Queen,
destroys all of the giant robots and the protagonists are buried in rubble as
the building collapses when the giant robot fuel cells detonate.

- 08: Honesty is the best policy

Ben and Edl's parents rescue the protagonists, digging them out of the rubble,
but Ben decides to scend Kaia while keeping everyone else captive. He explains
his motives. Ben wants to convince the other scenders that physical life is
useless. Ben says that he needs Kaia to be conscious while he scends her and
that it would be best if she cooperated. He explains that scenders cannot
forget anything ever and that if she experiences pain during the scending she
will remember it forever. He takes Kaia into a chamber where the fuel cells are
very far away, supposedly out of range. Ben operates the console with one hand,
though he says he can grow himself another hand later.

"I'll never become a scender. No one should live forever."

"If I can't convince you maybe some of you friends can."

The door opens and Ursa, Zek, Zok, Ursa, and Iona are brought in, all of them
bound by large metal shackles and surrounded by scenders as large as Edl and
holding spears and large shields.

"Where's Sata?"

Not paying attention to Kaia.

"Ursa, tell Kaia your story."

"Kaia, I wanted to tell you..."

"Ursa, get on with it."

"I was a man in my first life, but I hated it. When I heard about scenderism, I
saw it as a way to come back as who I was really meant to be."

Kaia tried to process what Ursa was saying.

"After I scended, I volunteered for any mission that would let me come back as
a woman. I really liked it. On each mission I would play a different
role. I always liked acting and no matter what role I was playing I always felt
like I was closer to the real me than I ever had in my first life."

"Tell her what you did on the missions."

"Sometimes I would get information or destroy something."

"Espionage and sabotage. What else, Ursa?"

"Sometimes I had to kill people."

"You completed hundreds of successful assassinations. You were the most
accomplished assassin in the scenderverse."

"When we met, where you on a mission?"

Ben laughed. "Yes, she was, but not for scenders. Now, Ursa serves the Dust Queen."

Kaia looked in disbelief at Ursa. "Why, Ursa?"

"The Dust Queen promised me that I could be a woman forever and even have a
baby."

Ursa helped build facilities to spread the Dust Queen's cult. Zek, Zok,
and Iona were Ursa's accomplices.

"Accomplice?! I was born on Mars and fought in the war. I saw the Thelusian
spacecraft crash into Mars. Ursa has never even been to Mars."

"I was there too. Zek and I stayed together the whole time even though our
people were on opposite sides in the war. Ursa joined us much later."

"Tell Kaia why you joined the Dust Queen."

"The Dust Queen promised to rebuild both Mars and Thelus if we followed her."

"Did you think that I was the villain? Ursa killed hundreds while working as a spy
and an assassin. Zek has soulswept countless people like you, driving them insane or
turning them into puppets for the Dust Queen."

"They are trying to overwrite your mind with the memories of the Dust Queen.
We want to preserve your brain the way it is. We want to study you to
understand your gifts and use them for the good of humanity."

"Can't you study me without killing me?"

"We can bring you back right after you scend. And your mind is continuously
being corrupted by the Dust Queen, so there's no time to waste."

"The scenders want to end physical life on Earth. The eternalEnlighted agree.
They are going to kill everyone on Earth with a virus. Our research can
convince them to not release the virus."

Ben begins to lower the circular saws the will remove the top of Kaia's skull.
Kaia channels the Dust Queen but she cannot reach any nearby fuel cells. She
resigns to her fate when she see Sata next to her. Sata controls Ben and has
him release her. Sata loses control of Ben and Edl attack Kaia. Ben thinks that
Kaia took control of him. Kaia blinds Ben and Edl, but she cannot open the
doors. Ben refuses to let her out and laughs at her feeble attempt to escape.
In a panic, Kaia slaps Ben in the face. He laughs at how weak her slap was, but
then starts to scream as his skin burns in the place where Kaia slapped him.
She tells him that the burning will continue until he lets her and everyone
else go. Ben says that he can handle the pain but the burn is disintegrating
his skin. He continues to resist until he loses half of his face and his jaw
becomes unhinged. Kaia is horrified by when she has done. Ben then opens the
door and shows her footage of her friends being released. She takes Ben as a
hostage and leaves Edl blind and screaming for her blood, because she hurt his
brother. The protagonists go to steal an airship to escape but the airships are
gone and Ben and Edl's parents are there waiting for them with an army of
scenders. They explain that they do not plan to let Kaia go. They say they can
always print another Ben. They say that he was right that Kaia was valuable.
They do not blame him for betraying them just to get the burning pain to stop.
Ben cries, but he cannot talk because the bottom right side of his face is
melted. Ben's parents try to convince Kaia that being a scender is a gift. They
say that Ben was the first algorithmically created consciousness to be placed
in a body. Everyone thought he would be disdainful of physical life, because he
was born in the scenderverse, but it was quite the opposite. Ben was the
greatest advocate for physical life among the scenders. Each one of the
scenders in our army is dedicated to the cause. They believe that scenderism is
the only true path for humanity. We can still learn things from chemical
intelligence, but physical life in general is wasteful. Keeping so many people
alive is holding back human progress. The only reason why scenders have not
enacted our plan of ending physical life is because Ben convinced us otherwise.
When Ben was a child he designed a companion for himself. He drew up the
schematics himself, not fully even understanding what he was doing. A
algorithmically created mind created another conscious being from nothing. We
still do not understand how he did it and have not been able to repeat this
feat ever since. You are another example of something we cannot explain. We
need you to join us so we can study your abilities for the good of humanity.
Kaia and Zek blind the scenders but the protagonists are overwhelmed by the
sheer volume of scenders. The scenders have shields and long spears. The
scenders arrange themselves in a Ancient Roman testudo formation. The scenders
know that they are immortal and that their painful deaths will not be recorded,
so they throw themselves into battle without holding anything back. The mimic
warrior cuts through the scenders with ease because it can move silently, evade
their spears, fit under their shields, and then slash and bite their tendons.
The scenders pile up on the protagonists and are about to take them captive.
Faced with a wall of spears and exhausted from fighting, the protagonists
consider surrendering. The scenders are stabbing blindly and moving in. The
protagonists have there backs against a wall. Kaia wants to surrender. Fera
asks why Kaia wants to surrender all the time, here and at the base. Fera stabs
Sata and tells Kaia to do something or they will all die. As Sata bleeds out,
Kaia channels the Dust Queen. At first, it seems like nothing has happened,
but soon the scenders start falling over one by one because the Dust Queen
stopped their breathing. From Kaia's view, the Dust Queen has replicated
herself and is strangling each of the scenders. The Dust Queen also tries to
strangle Fera, but cannot harm her. "See," Fera said, " all you needed was the
right motivation." The Dust Queen is furious that there is someone who she
cannot kill. The Dust Queen lashes out at Fera, but she an invisible shield
protects Fera. The Dust Queen slams against the invisible barrier until she
dissipates. Eiva and Fera stabilize Sata by infusing her with sinistrae blood.
They leave Ben because he has no value as a hostage. Edl comes out of hiding,
picks up Ben, and informs Kaia that he is no longer her friend after what she
did to Ben. Ryn guides them underground and the protagonists (Sata, Kaia, Eiva,
Fera, Zek, Zok, Ursa, Iona, and Ryn) head to Wessel lake in Wieliczka to hide
from the scenders.

- 09: Home sweet home

Fera and Eiva take Sata into the capsule and infuse her with self-replicating
sinistrae. Kaia is haunted by visions of the Dust Queen, but the visions
subside when Kaia enters the capsule. No one else can enter the capsule because they
are all dextrae based. Ursa and Ryn both start to have terrible abdominal
cramps and begins to cry uncontrollably. Iona starts to glitch. Zok begins to
wield energy and blows off both of his hands. The mimic warrior goes wild and
starts to lash and bite everyone randomly. Zek seems to go insane, loses
control, and blinds everyone except Kaia, Sata, Eiva, and Fera. Zek's snakes
writhe in pain. Kaia leaves the others because she is mostly concerned with
Sata. Fera is unsure of why Kaia does not appear to have any negative reactions
to sinistrae. Kaia stays in the capsule with Sata. Sata is unconsious and Kaia has
the first dreamless sleep in her life. The others are left in the dark at the
bottom of Lake Wessel. After they recover, they (Zek, Ursa, Ryn, and Iona) rush
to get Zok to a Lunker hospital. They (Zek, Zok, Ursa, Ryn, and Iona) are
captured by scenders who followed them into the tunnels. The scenders detonate
explosives to collapse the tunnels in Wieliczka burying Kaia, Sata, Fera, and
Eiva alive.

- 10: Nothing interesting happens - Kaia takes sinistrae
supplements to survive, while they dig themselves out. They are starving,
because Fera hides food for Eiva who is revealed to be pregnant. They fill the
capsule with rubble as they dig their way out. The AI still has a connection to
the internet and hires miners to dig through to the capsule. Eiva gives birth and
Kaia is near death from starvation when the miners break through. Fera and Eiva
start to organize an army to defeat the scenders. Kaia and Sata get ready to
rescue Zek, Zok, Ursa, Ryn, and Iona from the scenders. Mel joins them with
Driad warriors. Taz joins Fera's army with some army buddies who are
also addicted to sinistrae. Kaia is angry at Taz, but Fera accepts him with
open arms. Representatives of various oppressed people start to visit Fera,
e.g. Daka and Dzaa from the Mungs. They hatch a plan to rescue Zek, Zok, Ursa,
Iona, and Ryn. When Kaia arrives to save her friends, she is surprised that
there is no resistance. When she finds her friends, sees that Zek, Zok, Ursa,
Iona, and Ryn have made a deal with the scenders (to create a child with Kaia's
powers. Zek and Zok agree because they see an opportunity to realize their
dream of bringing back their ancient offspring and reclaiming Mars) and are
living comfortable. They say that the scenders mean her no harm and that Ursa
is pregnant and that scenders are taking care of them and that they do not want
to leave. Kaia bonds with the child while it is still in the womb. She forgets
about Fera and Sata (Eiva stayed behind with the baby). Sata decides to stay
with Kaia. Fera is furious with all of them but she calls her army back. Ryn
stays. Even though Ryn still is in love with Fera, he knows she does not love
him back and that he cannot go inside the capsule. The baby starts to destroy the
sinistrae in Sata and Kaia's systems. Sata starts to experience seizures again
and Kaia's visions return much stronger than before. Fera visits them and
starts bringing them sinistrae injections which they have to use more and more
frequently, as the baby becomes stronger. Ryn professes his love for Kaia and
Sata. He says he can concieve a child for them that will be carry a mix of
their DNA with his. Kaia and Sata accept Ryn as their surrogate mother and stop
the sinistrae injections so Ryn can get pregnant. Fera is a bit jealous that
Ryn has shifted his affection to Sata and Kaia, but hides it and says that if
they do not want the sinistrae injections that she will stop bringing them, but
she hopes that she can still visit. Sata and Kaia says that of course Fera can
visit and that she can also bring Eiva and her baby when she visits. Life
becomes very hard for Sata and Kaia without the sinistrae injections, as the
baby grows stronger, their conditions become worse. When the baby is born Sata
starts having so many absentee seizures that she is immobilized. Kaia lives in
two worlds simultaneously: on Earth with the baby and on Mars with the Dust
Queen, who is overjoyed with the birth of her offspring. Ryn gives birth to his
child with Sata and Kaia, a girl who looks like all three of them. They name
the girl Resa after Ryn's maternal grandmother. The live happily as they settle
into the new normal with two babies to take care. The baby girl is an angel and
does not need to be fed milk because she can photosynthesize. The boy
constantly demands attention and can keep Kaia awake even when he is asleep
because of the dreams he has. The baby girl grows up along side the baby boy
until he kills her with his nascent power. The baby boy got jealous of Kaia's
motherly love being split between the two babies. Sata is distraught and her
condition worsens. Kaia grieves by focusing on her baby son. Ryn is devastated
after first losing his sister and now his child. He isolates himself and throws
himself into his work. The mimic child begins to speak to him. Ryn thinks he is
going insane but the warrior explains that it is a conduit for a newly-formed,
nearby mimic civilization that self-constructed using instructions from a
distant mimic civilization. The conduit explains that mimics are conquerors and
tells Ryn to sow seeds of destruction to prepare Earth for invasion. Ryn is
happy to have a purpose and the conduit promises that Ryn will get the full
decode interstellar message and explanations on how to apply the knowledge of
his people. Ryn begins working on a means allow the new mimics to hijack the
dextrae peoplePrinters (don't tell readers this now, save it for later). Fera
takes Sata back to the capsule for recovery. When Sata returns she seems much
better but soon she gets very sick. Fera tries to administer sinistrae medicine
but it does not help. Zek, Zok, and Ryn cannot cure Sata so they help Sata
scend before she dies.

- 11 Welcome back

When Sata returns in a newly printed
body everything again seems fine, but during a training session with Zok and
Ursa, Sata kills both of the simultaneously, blowing off both of their heads
along with her hands. Zek and Iona attack, but Kaia causes Iona to freeze as
she begs them all to stop fighting. The sinistrae warriors (Fera, Mel, Taz,
etc.) kill Zek and tear off Iona's head. Kaia is left with her baby, the insane
Lita, Fera and her sinistrae warriors, and Iona's disembodied head. Kaia moves
into a cottage near Wieliczka. Ryn and the mimic child stay with her. Iona's
head keeps Kaia company. Fera, Eiva, and their daughter come to visit. Ryn
tells Kaia about Fera's deception. Fera replaced the consciousnesses of Zok,
Ursa, and Sata with warped versions of her own consciousness (How did Fera do
this? The AI helped her to obtain scender consciousnesses and conditioned them
to attack non-sinistrae.). She is keeping the original versions of their
consciousness hidden, so she can use them as leverage on Kaia in the future if
necessary. Kaia escapes with Ryn, the mimic child, her baby, and Iona's head.
They settle into a new normal, but then they are attacked by Ben and Edl. Ben
and Edl explains that they are receiving images from orbital satellites and
planes flying overhead to see themselves in third person, so Kaia will not be
able to blind them. Scenders surround Kaia and start closing in. "I am sure,
you can the same trick as before. Stop our breathing and then away. But we'll
be back. We won't remember having died. We won't get discouraged. We will never
give up. We can attack you on any clear day. We are infinitely patient. We will
eventually wear you down." The mimic child gets ready to attack but Kaia stops
it. Kaia channels the Dust Queen and instills such free into the scenders that
they all run off a cliff. Whenever Kaia channels the Dust Queen, their
connection becomes stronger and her visions become more intense. Ryn calls
mimic sharks and Kaia watches the sharks eat the scenders. The prospect of
repeatedly fighting the scenders and the intensification of the visions force
Kaia back to the cottage. Fera has constructed a Palace of bone (supposedly
made of the bones of her vanquished foes) on top of the ruins of Wawel castle
next to the cottage. Fera maintains that she did not do anything treacherous.
Ryn admits that he was lying. Kaia doesn't know who to believe.

- 12: Take your time

Kaia has a vision of Sata and is able to communicate with her thanks to
her son. The conversation proves that Fera had been lying. Sata has final
memories were of their daughter dying and going back to Wieliczka. Kaia
resolves to bring back Sata no matter the cost. Ryn promises to help Kaia,
because he is in love with both Sata and Kaia, and no longer loves Fera. Iona
promises to help Kaia bring back Sata if they also bring back Zek, Zok, and
Ursa. Kaia agrees. The first book ends with Kaia filled with doubts about being
to rescue Lita (rescue her from where?). She needed some kind of leverage over
Fera (but could she do? Fera seems to be in complete control). With Kaia's
deteriorating mental state, she felt trapped and helpless. What if she never
sees Sata again? What if the visions consume her? Her son scares her when he
says the he has three mommies, one on Earth (Kaia), one on Mars (the Dust
Queen), and one in the scenderverse (Ursa). That he has two daddies, one in the
scenderverse (Zok) and the other one on Mars (Zek). He feels very lucky to have
so many parents. Her son explains that the dreams are coming from Mars, and
that they are not bad dreams, but rather reminders that they need to go to
Mars. If they do not go to Mars, then the daddy on Mars will be very mad and
the reminders will become more and more powerful. Kaia thinks that the dreams
are different for her son. He welcomes the dreams. Kaia is being destroyed by
them. If she does not get to Mars, she will go mad. She does not have the means
to rescue Sata or make it Mars, so she just has to survive until Fera makes
good on her promise to reclaim Mars. Kaia decides that she will bide her time
and wait for an opportunity to force Fera to release Sata.

## Book 2

The first book ends before Fera consolidates control over Earth, so there is a
question of whether there will be a war between sinistrae and dextrae again and
what role Kaia and her baby will play in that war. In the second book, Fera
makes plans to consolidate power over Earth and invade Mars. Fera explains that
Kaia is integral to her plans of conquering Mars. Fera presents her plan to
CorporateCouncil, DemocraticDelegation, and the eternalEnlighted. Fera is made
a general and given command of the joint armies of Earth. Ryn follow through
with his plan of allowing the new mimics infiltrating Earth through the
peoplePrinters. When Fera goes to reclaim Mars, she does it with a coalition of
sinistrae and dextrae forces. She has the blessing of the Earth government and
the forces refer to her as General Fridzia. As soon as the combat begins on
Mars, the mimics attack Earth, take control of all peoplePrinters, and start
printing mimics, mimic warriors, and mimic animals. The new mimics are
different that the old mimics. New mimics cannot get pregnant, instead they can
impregnate human men and women and mimic men and women through sexual
intercourse. Human men typically die after giving birth to a new mimic baby,
while human women typically survive the birth. Mimic men and women have the
best chances of surviving a new mimic birth. Plenty of opportunities for goring
descriptions of the births. Old mimics can only become pregnant themselves
after interacting with humans, they cannot impregnate others. Since the
invading mimics have their consciousnesses printed into human-like bodies, it
becomes difficult to say who is human, new mimic, and old mimic. The new mimic
bodies did not adapt to Earth, but their design is tailored to the task of
dominating Earth. Fera's army is repelled from Mars and they find that Earth is
under the control of the mimics. The people of Earth see Fera as their only
hope. Reli Corp stock skyrockets and Fera becomes extremely popular on social
media. Fera becomes head of the Earth government in exile. Trapped between a
hostile Earth and a hostile Mars, Fera sets up a new base of operations in
space with the Mungs and the space prisoners. Fera plans to retake Earth while
repelling the Martian invasion. The Thelusians are very good at building and
fighting in space. Fera has to rely on the space expertise of Mungs and the
space prisoners. Eiva and her daughter escape to space to be with Fera. Kaia
and her son turn into villains (the second Dust Queen and the Shade Prince)
and attack Earth while the sinistrae fight against the new mimics. The
sinistrae must fight a war on two fronts. The dextrae firepower on Earth is
formidable and the Thelusians are experts in using dextrae for space warfare.
Everyone starts thinking that the sinistrae will be crushed. What saves them?
The power of friendship? Sata and Kaia? No, Sata cannot even recognize Kaia
now. Eiva's daughter convinces the Shade Prince to form an alliance. He strikes
a deal with her. In exchange for help against the new mimics, she must marry
him and agree to rule both planets together. She agrees. She has feelings for
him, but recognizes that he is acting like a villain. She does what she has to
in order to save her people. After they are married, the Thelusians allow the
sinistrae to recover and focus their full power on attacking Earth. The
Thelusians kill humans, old mimics, and new mimics indiscriminately in their
attempt to conquer the planet. The new mimics were not expecting to fight the
Thelusians and say that Ryn should have warned them about the possibility.
Eiva's daughter thinks Kaia's son broke his promise, but he says that he
promised to fight the new mimics, not protect everyone else. He adds that it is
impossible to tell who is who, so killing everyone is the only viable solution.
The sinistrae watch as Earth is engulfed in the war between Thelusians and new
mimics. All of the inhabitants of Earth consider the Thelusians to be their
common enemy and join forces to fight the Thelusians together. Eiva's daughter
has to live on a Thelusian ship with Kaia's son. She goes with him willingly to
secure the alliance, but then she regrets it. She is treated very well, but she
hates having to watch the war unfold while Kaia's son treats her like a prized
pet. She feels like a caged bird. The inhabitants of Earth try to destroy the
peoplePrinters to stop the flow of new mimics. The new mimics still need humans
or old mimics to reproduce, so they prefer to capture them rather than kill
them. From the perspective of the new mimics, old mimics are the most highly
prized captives, human women are considered fairly valuable captives, and human
men are the least valuable captives. Old mimics try to form an alliance with
humans to resist the new mimics, but it is difficult, because they do not know
who is who as new mimics have a separate hivemind. Old mimics can recognize
each other, as can new mimics, but humans have no idea and doubt everyone. The
second book ends with Eiva's daughter feeling trapped. She has sex with Kaia's
son to cement the alliance. She saved the sinistrae, but wonders what kind of
monster she married. Her husband is fine with indiscriminately killing everyone
on Earth. The people of Earth become disillusioned with Fera as she scrambles
to organize a force to retake Earth and handle the influx of refugees from
Earth. Eiva's daughter's marriage is the key to keep the refugees alive. She
feels betrayed by her mothers who tell her she has to do everything that will
be necessary to secure victory and the survival of sinistrae. Fera enacts a
plan to move the refugees and food produce satellites on the opposite side of
the Sun. The people on the other side of the sun form their own nation. Once
the refugees, Mungs, sinistrae, and space prisoners are safe, Eiva's daughter
escapes to Earth to fight for the safety of anyone who was not able to escape.
Eiva's daughter finding out that she can distinguish between humans, new
mimics, and old mimics, using sinistrae injections. Old mimics become
plant-like, new mimics turn into predators, while humans benefit from the
sinistrae injections. She starts off by indiscriminately killing new mimics,
but then becomes convinced that new mimics born on Earth can be good. She
starts protecting new mimic children, even though everyone else sees them as
the enemy. She continues organizing the resistance even after she realizes she
is pregnant with Kaia's son's child. The book ends with her looking up at the
stars wondering what she should do about the baby and what will happen when her
husband finds her. He seems like he cares about her a great deal, but he will
probably want to kill all of the new mimic children she is protecting.

How are Sata and Kaia reunited? The Dust Queen says she will help Kaia get
Sata back, but Kaia must stop resisting the Dust Queen. Desperate to be with
Sata again, Kaia agrees. She feels the Dust Queen guiding her. The Dust Queen
guides her to the ruins of a library (Biblioteka Jagiellonska?). There she
meets Granny, an elderly woman who gives her a few books: UNO: the Complete
Reference, Historia Martis, and a sudoku puzzle book. "How do you know these
are the books I need?" "These books came to me in a dream." "Do you dreams of
Mars?" "At this point, I live on Mars and sometimes have dreams of Earth." "Do
I need to read these books?" "You can if you wish, but I believe it will not be
necessary." When Fera visits, Fera takes interest in Historia Martis, she
starts reading and cannot put the book down, looking for clues to defeat the
Dust Queen. "You can go now Mommy, I will keep her here. Mars Mommy is helping
me." With Fera distracted Kaia leaves her son with Fera, Iona, and Ryn. She
enters the capsule and finds the AI. The Dust Queen tells her to give the sudoku
book to the AI. I brought you a puzzle book. What kind of puzzles? Sudoku.
Please provided username and password. The Dust Queen whispered in Kaia's ear.
Guess the password? (the UNO AI is brought under control when Kaia tries to use
a defective sudoku puzzle to cause it to glitch. the AI, "command ku not
found", "Guess the password," a voice whispered "Guess the password?!" Kaia
exclaimed, "Password accepted. Welcome guest," the AI responded). Welcome user
guest. Command ku not found. Please try again with another command. I want to
find Sata. User Satalitastra Azymuta is stored in my memory banks. Release Sata
into the scenderverse. Should I move or copy? Copy. Now Kaia needs to make a
deal with Ben and Edl to print Sata out. She says that she will allow them to
scend her if they print out Sata. They agree but only if Kaia is already
scended. The Dust Queen tells her to accept. They inject her with dextrae
nanotech, shave her head, and remove the top of her skull, and cover the dura
with a nanotech gel, and prepare to dissect her brain. Tendrils extend from the
machine and cover every inch of brain. The Dust Queen enters their system
through the tendrils and takes control, releasing Kaia's restraints, and
replacing the top of her skull, stapling it in place. Kaia realizes that the
Dust Queen was using her to enter the scenderverse and gain control of the
dextrae systems. The Dust Queen begins to replicate in the scenderverse and
terrorize the people there. Kaia prints out Sata. They are reunited. They go
back for Kaia's son. When they arrive, the Dust Queen springs from the book
Fera is still reading and starts strangling her. Kaia's son had been slowly
destroying Fera's sinistrae, so she was not shielded against the Dust Queen's
attack. Kaia tries to save Fera, but realizes that the only way to save her is
to escape with her son. Without the presence of Kaia and her son, Fera would
eventually recover. From Fera's perspective, it looks like Kaia and Sata showed
up, Kaia used her powers to strangle Fera, and left her for dead while escaping
with her son, Iona's head, and Sata. Fera recovers. She realizes that she no
longer has any leverage over Kaia. Fera organizes a search party and chases
after Kaia et al., because Kaia is integral to Fera's plan to invade Mars. Kaia
is also the reason why Fera was never challenged by dextrae forces. The news
spread quickly of Kaia's ability to destroy energy sources at will. If anyone
learned that Kaia is no longer under Fera's control, the dextrae forces may
attack starting a new dextrae - sinistrae war.

What happens after Kaia's escape (above) but before the invasion of Mars?
...

The Dust Queen stays quiet in the scenderverse and waits for the invasion of
Mars.

How does this affect Ryn's plan?

Ryn enacts his plan quietly. Printing out mimic invaders masquerading as
humans.

When the invasion of Mars begins the Dust Queen starts printing Thelusians
from the scenderverse.

The Thelusians start killing everyone indiscriminately.

The people of Earth start destroying peoplePrinters to stop the flood of
Thelusians.

The new mimics should stay hidden until their numbers are superior.

Once the peoplePrinters are destroyed, the new mimics start to reproduce
sexually, leading to unexplained deaths, and male pregnancy (human males who
become pregnant are mistaken for mimics).

Suspicious of this, the government begins to wonder if mimics have mutated to
become more hostile. They renew the sinistrae injection program. The presence
of new mimics is revealed by the sinistrae injections which turns the new
mimics into monstrous sexual predators. The sinistrae injections are also the
only way to save someone who is pregnant with a new mimic baby. Reli Corp
skyrockets again.

Humans have to join forces with new mimics and old mimics to fight the
Thelusians, but the government kills any found to be a new mimic.

The Thelusians can self-replicate and spread quickly.

As the balance of the war begins to favor the Thelusians, Ryn negotiates with
the Earth government to get a truce between humans and new mimics.

The Thelusians gain control of Earth's orbital defenses which prevents Fera
from returning to Earth.

Earth's military is stuck between Mars and Earth. Refugee ships are shot down
by Earth's orbital defenses.

Fera gives up Eiva's daughter to Kaia's son in exchange for an armistice with
the Thelusians. In reality the Thelusians are bluffing and they do not have the
means to challenge Earth's military in space, that is why the Shade Prince can
convince the Dust Queen to accept a truce in exchange for Eiva's daughter. Fera
sets up a new base of operations in space. She trains in extreme G. Fera
contacts Ryn to make a deal with the new mimics. Fera tells the new mimics that
they have to destroy Earth's orbital defenses so that Fera can bring Earth's
military to the surface. The new mimics are happy to oblige because they know
that a mimic armada is on its way and that destroying the orbital defenses will
soften the Earth for the coming invasion.

By fighting alongside the humans and old mimics, the new mimics realize that
they have a lot in common and start to consider the prospect of living
peacefully with humans, as the old mimics were trying to do.

Fera makes it back to Earth and Eiva's daughter escapes her husband (she later
finds out that she is pregnant with his child). They fight the Thelusians
together.

Eiva's daughter falls for a new mimic who also gets her pregnant. She tells her
lover that she is pregnant already. He says that it does not matter to him. She
does not know he is new mimic. She gives birth to two babies, one human, the
other new mimic. She doesn't know that the smaller child is a new mimic. She
thinks that she have birth to two human twins. She gets suspicious when one of
the children looks like her lover and has a deep connection with him. The
sinistrae in her body kept her alive during the difficult pregnancy and birth.
When she finds out that her lover is new mimic, she is devastated. He says that
she would have rejected him, perhaps even tried to kill him if she had known.
Eiva's daughter reconciles with her lover, because she needs his help. Will she
learn to love her mimic child? The mimic child resembles her and loves her.
She cannot bring herself to reject or harm her mimic child.

...

Zek and Zok worship the Dust Queen and serve her biding. The birth of Kaia's
son and the invasion of Mars was part of the Dust Queen's plan. Was Pyr
bullying Kaia also part of the plan? Zek and Zok have been building relay
stations all over the planet with copies of the Dust Queen inside. This allows
the Dust Queen to have instant access to Kaia at all times. Sata decides to
join the Dust Queen, just to be with Kaia. Sata becomes the Dust Queens
all-seeing eye and allows the Dust Queen to possess and control dextrae users.
The all-seeing greatly amplifies the Dust Queen's power. Kaia and Sata remain
in love despite being undead and evil.

Sata must be reunited before Kaia goes to Mars, so Sata can see Kaia becoming
the Dust Queen. Fera invades Mars, but realizes it is a trap. Kaia uses her
powers to destroy Thelusians but by channeling the The Dust Queen she goes
insane and joins the The Dust Queen. The Dust Queen also eventually corrupts
Kaia's son. He recognizes her as his mother. On Mars, Kaia goes insane and
becomes the Dust Princess. The mistake that everyone made was assuming that
the power that Kaia wielded was coming from Kaia. Whenever Kaia channeled the
Dust Queen's power she lost a little bit of herself. The Echo dreams had been
conditioning Kaia for this moment her whole life. Together with her son and
older self, Kaia repels the sinistrae invasion, which already have started to
pull back to save Earth, (home court advantage) and creates an new army of
sinistrae and dextrae Thelusians. Zek and Zok see this is a realization of
their plan. Ursa wants to stay with her son. Iona joins them as she sees it as
a chance for the Thelusian civilization to regain its dominance of space. Mars
and Earth prepare for interplanetary war. Without Kaia and her son, the
sinistrae are no match for dextrae firepower and have to retreat. The Dust
Queens plan to spread their power to Earth and since the sinistrae do not have
the firepower to stop them, they launch an invasion immediately. Eiva's
daughter tries to convince Kaia's son to broker peace, but he says that they
will have peace Earth is conquered. He says that he wants to rule both planets
with Eiva's daughter at his side as his queen. Sata tries to convince Kaia to
come back to her, but Kaia is consumed to the point that Sata cannot tell which
of the two Dust Queens are her Kaia. The invasion is a success. As part of the
surrender agreement, Eiva's daughter marries Kaia's son and they will rule both
planets as the bone princess and the shadow prince. The Thelusian civilization
is rebuilt with Iona as its Queen. The Thelusians enslave the Mungs and space
prisoners. Zek and Zok marry the Dust Queens and become the Dust Kings.
Eiva's daughter is pregnant. Kaia's son is happy to have an heir to the throne,
even though he believes that his reign will be eternal. Sata, Fera, and Eiva
are confined in the bone palace (a palace built from the bones of Fera's
enemies on top of the ruins of Wawel castle) and help take care of the baby.
Ryn plans to destroy both sinistrae and dextrae, though he is unsure if it will
be possible to change anything now that the villains have complete control of
both Mars and Earth. The book ends with Ryn contacting a nearby mimic
civilization that was built from s from sinistrae and dextrae particles that
started to react to signals sent by distant mimic civilizations. The particles
self-construct into a non-organic mimic civilization. The mimics reveal that
they are intergalactic conquerors and that purpose of the messages were to have
mimics infiltrate planets and conquer planets them from within or to soften
their defense before the eventual invasion. The mimic civilization asks if the
people of Earth and Mars were kind to him and other mimics. Ryn replies that
they were not. The mimic civilization instructs Ryn to wait for the invasion.
As mimics do not age, Ryn will still be alive when the invasion arrives. Ryn
decides not to warn anyone about the invasion. Ryn doesn't want to wait for the
invasion, so he enters a stasis pod like the one Eiva used. As Ryn enters the
pod, he thinks about everyone and wonders if they will still be alive when he
wakes up.

## Trunderstudy

"What's a trunderstudy?"

"A triple understudy. It is like a vice president, or rather a vice vice vice
president.", Aira explained, counting on her fingers with each "vice". "If
something happens to the lead performer, the understudy, and the dunderstudy,
then I have to be ready to take over, so that the show can go on."

## Eiva's daughter

"Look at what she can do.", Eiva proudly gesturing towards her daughter.
Fera looked in amazement as the skeleton in front of them danced.

"She can move it with her mind? Did you know she could do that?", Fera asked.

"Throw a bone knife at my face."

"What? No!"

"Fine, aim at my stomach. If I can't block it, you can always stitch up me
afterwards, but I'm not in any danger, because you throw like a girl."

Fera's favorite activity other than skating was throwing rocks. Whenever she
was too tired to skate, she would spend hours throwing rocks at abandoned
buildings. Throwing rocks was an outlet for the anger that Fera felt.

"Come on! Let's see what that noodle arm can do. I bet you can't even reach
me!"

Fera did not need any further encouragement. She threw a bone knife straight at
Eiva's chest.

Eiva did not move a muscle, but the knife got knocked away in mid-air.

"I was the best sinistrae wielder during the war. Changing the paths of thrown
bone knives was my specialty. Too bad I couldn't deflect dextrae bullets during
the war."

"With Kaia, we don't need to deflect the bullets. She can blow up all of their
weapons. If the blasts don't kill them, our arrows and knives will."

Zek and Zok are not actually twins. Danilo created Echo and Scender versions of
himself. The Echo version, Zek, was born to a surrogate mother that Danilo
hired and then conditioned with Danilo's mind using Echo tech. The Scender
version, Zok, was printed from a scan of a previous Echo's mind. Zek fights in
a mixed style, while Zok is pure melee tank. Zek pretends to be Iona's
boyfriend, while Zok pretends to be Ursa's boyfriend. In reality, they are all
polyamorous. Zek fixes Iona when she needs repair and tries to make sure she is
comfortable. Zok tries to keep Ursa entertained. Zok is more muscular and
better looking than Zek while Zek is more nerdy and tech savvy. Kaia meets Zek
and Zok (the twins as Lan introduces them) on the airship. The airship crashes
because Kaia has a dream about the Dust Queen destroying the fuel cell, which
results in the fuel cell actually exploding in real life. Zek and Zok are
responsible for the Echo dreams that Kaia experiences. They are secretly amazed
by Kaia's ability to destroy fuel cells and decide to encourage her to develop
this talent. They tell Kaia that she was responsible for the airship, she is
dismayed, but they tell her that she can learn to control her power. The power
to destroy fuel cells comes in handy when they go to rescue Aira and Lan.

## Martian book
Anyone non-Echo who looks at the text in the book loses the ability to breathe.
Only by understanding Martian text can someone look at the book's text and survive.

## Combat
The first time we see major combat is when everyone sets out to rescue Aira and
Lan.

Edl, Ursa, Zok, and Iona are tanks
Kaia, Ben, and Sata are ranged
Zek and the sinistrae (Fera, Eiva, and Mel) are mixed
Taz refuses to come, because he says that Aira lied to him

Sata is mostly useful as a scout. Ryn in useless at all times. Ben is fairly
useless with his robotic birds, because Kaia can blow up any animalAutomatons
before Ben can hack them. Ben is mostly good for scouting with his birds,
opening doors, and accessing schematics. The major advantage is provided by
Kaia who causes energy weapons and exoskeleton armor power suits to explode.
The government soldiers who remove their energy-powered gear and avoid the
explosions are left with only combat knives. None of the characters are immune
to the combat knives, so there is still real danger, but their powers allow
them to quickly defeat the government soldiers. For example, the government
soldiers are not able to fight effectively when Kaia and Zek blind and
disorient them. To keep the battles from being one-sided, the protagonists
split up. How should they split up? Anyone who Kaia, has no problem. Without
Kaia, Zek and the sinistrae have to use stealth and the tanks have to use
lightning fast offense. The government facilities also contain genetically
engineered soldiers (GES) with pangolin armor plating growing on their bodies.
The GES can use echo location to find their foes, so they can continue fighting
even after Echos blind them. The Scender tanks have trouble defeating the GES,
so the sinistrae get to show off their powers. In comparison with the regular
government soldiers, all Echos, Sinistrae, and Scenders seem really OP. The
final battle is against a giant robot with a fuel cell that Kaia cannot explode
because it would destroy the entire facility. Instead Kaia destroys anything on
the robot that has an independent fuel cell, e.g. gun turrets. The scender
tanks (Edl, Ursa, and Zok) and sinistrae (Fera, Eiva, and Mel) have to team up
to destroy the giant robot. Zek is useless against it. Ben tries to hack it.
Is Sata a sinistrae at this point? I think she shouldn't be.

## Parents
Kaia and Sata miss their parents (who are they?).
Fera misses her mom, not her abusive father.
Zek, Zok, Ursa, Ryn, Aira, Lan, and Iona do not have living parents.
Ben and Edl have great relationships with their parents who try to hide the fact that Edl was synthesized by Ben when he was a child.
Dzaa and Daka's parents are in space.
Taz and Mel are adults.

## Ryn
Ryn gets pregnant from Fera. When she discovers sinistrae, Ryn miscarries. He
is heartbroken and cannot be near her again, so he tries to invent a way to
inoculate mimics against sinistrae and eventually adapt their reproductive
systems to sinistrae. He fails to create the inoculation and later falls in
love with Kaia.

## Mungs

Intro two new characters named Dzaa and Daka. Aka is a Mung girl who needs
exoskeletons to move around on earth because she suffers from osteogeneza
imperfecta and her bones are brittle and weak after a lifetime in space. Dzaa
is a Mung girl who grew up on a spacecraft that was spinning wildly out of
control. After a lifetime of being exposed to extreme G forces, Dzaa became
extremely strong, the exact opposite of Aka. Dzaa falls for Edll, because he is
the only man she has seen who can rival her strength. Ben takes an interest in
Daka's exoskeleton, which she built herself in space (a throwback to his
earlier interest in Fera). The Mung people are named after the Mung beans that
they grow in space as a protein source for Earth. The Mungs consist of various
ethnicities that were driven into space when larger, more powerful neighbours
took over their land. The Mungs believe that Tengri, the sky god, saved them
from conflict on Earth by accepting them into the sky. The government views
them as space parasites and promotes several stereotypes and misconceptions
regarding Mungs, e.g. that they use their babies to plug holes in their
spacecraft. Mungs fight with prisoners sent to space. The government does not
recognize Mungs as a people. Mungs want a sovereign nation. The government
cracks down on any political activity and indiscriminately destroyed Mung ships
before but had stopped since the Mungs learn to throw space rocks at Earth with
great precision. Currently, there is a stalemate.

Dzaa and Daka are sent to Earth to talk with Fera after the Mung people she her
success as CEO of Reli Corp and connect it to the recording of Fera's protest.

The girls plead with Fera to help the Mungs gain sovereignty from the government.

Fera tells that them after the revolution, there will be freedom for everyone,
even Mungs.

"and Lunkers." Ryn added cautiously.

"Yes, Lunkers and Mungs."

"What about Atlantans?"

"The fish people? Ok, sure they can have freedom and equality too."

"What about Driads?"

"Yes, the tree people can also have freedom."

"What about-"

"Stop naming various ethnicities already! Look, everyone will get freedom and equality."

It is very important for Mungs to be a sovereign nation. We don't want end up like the Zeppelinomads.

Nomads that roamed the air in the their floating cities. To be honest, they
were a nuisance. They would hunt birds for food, hijack airships, and dump
their trash on the people below. Luckily, the government wiped them all out by
igniting all of their hydrogen and taking away all of their precious helium.

Driads show up to ask Fera to promise that she will protect the trees,
Atlantans ask Fera to promise to respect the oceans. Fera agrees in exchange
for their promise to support the revolution.

A descendant of the Zeppelinomads approaches Fera asking for her help to rebuild
the Zeppelin civilization. Fera's advisors tell her not to because Zeppelinomads
were jerks.

"Why is there a downvote arrow on your head?"

Fera asks what the Zeppelinomads what he can bring to the revolution.
He says that he can control the air.

"What good are gusts of wind good for?"

"Well if you have sails, I can fill them with air on windless day."

Fera waited for additional benefits, but then realized that the list ended with
the first item.

"Ok, so you will be useful when we are on some kind of vehicle propelled by
wind."

"Yes, the obvious example is a sailboat, but land yachts also have sails.
There's also parasailing, paragliding, and windsurfing."

Fera asks him for a demonstration, but the
exposure to sinistrae makes the demo very unimpressive.

"I think I felt something, but honestly I am not sure."

"That's what SHE said!" Eiva broke out laughing, then stopped laughing when she
saw that no one else was laughing.

"You don't have that joke here?"

"Obviously not, what's so funny?"

"Well, here is a guy who started off really confident, tried really hard to
impress us with skills until he was red in the face, and we barely felt a
thing, and I said that's what SHE said." Eiva broke out laughing again.

"It honestly is really funny. Y'all just don't understand." Eiva said a bit offended.

"Ok, I have seen enough. How many soldiers do you have?"

"Soldiers?"

"Yes, how many soldiers can you contribute to the revolution?"

"Zeppelinomads were always peaceful. We only stole what we needed for our
floating cities."

"Ok, if you do not have any soldiers, what do you have? Workers? Inventors?
Farmers?"

"We never farmed because we were nomads and lived in floating cities, but we
raised on our own birds. There were workers and inventors in Zeppelin
civilization, but now I am the only left."

"Wait, you're the only left?"

"Yes, as far as I know."

"And your only talent is moving air around?"

"Yes, but I am sure that with time and training I could master the other elements as well."

"Ok, I think we may have a use for you. Your job is stand next to me and fan
me. I don't want you speak, just fan me silently while looking at me with
complete admiration. I don't want to know your name. I will just call you
fanboy."

"Where should I get the fan?"

"Show a little initiative and find the fan yourself, you little runt! Do you
think the bone queen should solve all of your problems? Get going before I fill
you with hydrogen and light you on fire!" Fera exploded, finally losing her
patience.

Fera later becomes the CorporateCouncil Chair and becomes the most popular
streamer in the DemocracticDelegation. She is exhausted from constant work
meetings and never-ending demands from her followers for more content. She
shares videos of Eiva and her baby girl along with videos of Kaia and her baby
boy. Fera's followers speculate that Kaia, Eiva, and Fera are in a polyam
(polyamorous) relationship. Kaia does not use social media so only finds out
when she talks to Lita via her son. Lita is jealous. She thinks that Kaia got
rid of her so that she could live with Eiva and Fera.

"We are the Driads, we speak for the trees!"

Fera stations guards around the secret locations of the eternalEnlighted. If
the eternalEnlighted ever disobey her, the guards are instructed to destroy all
of the brain tanks. She grants sovereignty to the Atlantans, Driads,
Mungs, and Lunkers, as she promised, and she forms two new branches of
government: a monarchy with her as the queen and a council with a
representative from the Atlantans, the Driads, the Lunkers, and the Mungs.

Fera gives herself a permanent seat on the new council with veto power and puts
her fanboy on the Council as the Zeppeliner representative and uses him as her
puppet.

Ryn asks for a seat on the council for mimics. Ben virtually represents scenders,
because he still cannot obtain a body. Kaia is asked to represent Martians.
Iona represents Thelusians.

Fera controls all branches of government. She is the matriarchalMonarch, the
permanent queen of the entire government, and Eiva's daughter will be Queen
after her. Kaia's son is referred to as the dark prince, he has no claim to the
throne, because only women can be matriarchalMonarchs. Kaia has to keep her
son's powers a secret. The other 4 branches of government advise her. She has
veto power and final say over their decisions. Fera is Chair of the
CorporateCouncil and the most popular streamer in the DemocracticDelegation.
She is a permanent member of the electedEthnicities representing sinistrae.
Dextrae do no get representation in the government.

Fera is planning to invade Mars and recover it from the Thelusians. Having
complete control of Earth, she launches her assault on Mars.

The next books focus on Eiva's daughter and Kaia's son. Eiva's daughter is
training to be queen. Kaia's son is not as good at controlling sinistrae as
Eiva's daughter. He is jealous of his older "sister". He has no claim to the
throne. He still has dreams of Mars. His mother's dreams bleed over into his
dreams. He wants to bring back his father, his other mother, his mother's
friend, but he cannot since dextrae technology has been banned. He has to keep
his ability to control dextrae a secret. He is planning to destroy the current
world and bring back dekstrae.

When Kaia and Lita are reunited.

Kaia was apprehensive. She could not help be remember the last time she stood
over a peoplePrinter waiting for Lita to be brought back to life. Her son
assured her that this time would be different. He was printing a body for Lita
that was many years older than the body she had before so Kaia and Lita could
be the same age, like before. Kaia was braced for heartbreak. When the lid to
the personPrinter opened, she was already in tears. Lita got out the
personPrinter, Kaia was amazed with amazing she looked. Kaia searched Lita's
face for signs of hatred or resentment. What she saw in Lita's face prompted
Kaia to throw her arms around Lita and hug her. Lita hugged her back. Her smell
was the same as before. Her touch was electrifying. Kaia did not allow herself
to believe just yet.

Kaia asks a question that only Lita can answer. When Lita answers it correctly,
Kaia gasps and reaches out to touch Lita's face. "It's really you." Lita nods.
They are both crying. Kaia starts to explain. "The years without you. Every
night I dreamt of you." Lita placed a hand on either side of Kaia's face and
gazed deeply into her eyes as they widened with shock. Lita crashed her face in
Kaia's, kissing her deep. Kaia melted into Lita's strong yet soft hands. The
room exploded with colors. Had they never kissed before? Kaia realized that she
had never really kissed anyone before. Kaia broke from the kiss. She was
hyperventilating and her head was spinning. She held onto Lita, who looked at
her with an amused expression on her face.

"Was it that good? I wasn't expecting you get all googly eyed on me."

Kaia started to laugh. Lita was back after years living as in the scenderverse.
Her worries that things would be different were dispelled. The horrible
waiting, the terrible uncertainty, the crushing doubt, all of it faded away.
Kaia couldn't express what she was feeling.

"We should probably get going. We have a planet to reconquer." Kaia's son said,
uncomfortable with the intense display of affection.

Kaia had forgotten she was not alone with Lita. Kaia became annoyed and was no
longer willing to hide her emotions.

"I've waited years for this. I never asked any of you for anything, never
anything for myself. Get the hell out and leave us alone!"

Kaia's son was shocked.

"Sure, no problem. You're welcome for reuniting you with the love of your life
by the way. Now that I've accomplished the impossible, I'll just go and sit in
a dark room by myself."

Kaia pulled Lita by the hand towards the table, thinking they could chat and
catch up after years of separation. Lita pulled Kaia in, wrapping her arms
around her lower back and burying her head in Kaia's chest.

"These are bigger than I remember."

Kaia struggled to catch her breath. Her heart was pounding. She felt like she
had been running for hours. Lita grabbed Kaia's hands and rested them on her
shoulders. Then grabbing the backs of Kaia's thighs, Lita lifted Kaia up with
ease and gently sat her down on the table.

"Were did you learn these moves?"

"I've been planning this for years and I watched a lot of naughty videos while
I was waiting for you to make me a new body."

Kaia laughed. "Are you planning to do something naughty to me?"

"I honestly wouldn't even know where to begin.", Lita admitted, "I was a virgin
before I died and I didn't even have a body in the scenderverse, much less a love life."

"I'm still a virgin too.", Kaia said bashfully.

"Shut up! How can you be a virgin when you have a kid?", Lita said, putting her hands on her hips.

"No, it's true! Zek did-"

"I remember. You told me before. I was just teasing you."


No one can carry a cellphone because during the war cellphone's could be caused
to detonate spontaneously. Kaia later learns to detonate anything with a fuel
cell, e.g. powerskates, powergloves, energy weapons, airships, etc. Kaia has a
dream that she is the Dust Queen crawling through the airship. She finds the
airship fuel cells and destroys them. When Kaia wakes up the fuel cells have
actually been destroyed. The airship crashes into Zakrz√≥wek quarry lake.

Bring in a Relic character to be a romantic partner for Dela. The capsules are
all connected. The AI explains that there is a survivor from the war between
sinistrae and dekstrae intact in stasis. The AI explains that Eiva is pregnant
and she was selected to be the first person to be awakened as part of the plan
to bring about the resurgence of sinistrae. The AI tells Fera that she should
awaken Eiva and start introducing her to the new world and meanwhile Eiva will
teach Fera how to use sinistrae powers. When Eiva awakens she admits that Eiva
was not originally her name, but the AI said that she would pick a new name for
her that matched the time when she was awakened. Eiva's husband died trying to
protect the capsules and keep them hidden. The AI does not try to create a full
name for Eiva and instead suggests that she add Fera's mother's name and Fera's
maternal grandmother's name (Eivavikadela Fridzia) and pretend she is Fera's sister.

Eiva and Fera develop a relationship and start sleeping together.

"After being frozen for thousands of years, I thought you might be a bit... frigid."

Eiva tackled Fera and started to throttle her.

"Oh, how did you know that's what I'm into?", Dela said, laughing.

Ryn discovers them. "You are together with Eiva?!" Then, a mischievous look
overtook Ryn's face. "Remember when you accused me of sleeping with my sister?
Turns out that you're an incestuous hypocrite."

Eiva looked puzzled.

"You're going to pay for that, you filthy moleman!"

Fera thinks that Eiva was lying to her about being pregnant. Eiva says she did
not know she was pregnant. She did not know it was possible for an embryo to
survive stasis. "When the baby is born, will our relationship change?", Fera
asked nervously.

Eiva's baby is a girl. Kaia's baby is a boy.

## Fera and Eiva name their baby

---
"What was your name before?"
"It doesn't matter. That was a different life."
"It matters to me."
"Desir√©e."
"What?"
"It means desired in French. My friends would call me Dezi."
"Were you French? In the Ancient times?"
"No, but it was common to give children French names back then."
"Ok, I can understand why the AI gave you a new name. Your old name was complete trash."
Eiva tackled Fera.
"Can I call you Dezi? When no one else is around? It can be our little secret."
Eiva's eyes filled with tears. She enveloped Fera in her arms.
"Maybe you can name your baby Dezi? If it's a girl."
"That wouldn't work though, right? Don't female names have to end in 'a'? It would have to be Deza."
"After we overthrow the government and abolish the name laws, you can name your baby whatever you want."
"Stop saying **your** baby."
"What? Why?"
"It'd make me happy if you said **our** baby."
Fera knew in that moment that she would do anything to protect Eiva and **their** baby.
---

Sinistrae disrupt dextrae technology. Fera began to tap away at a console. With
every touch, the screen became increasingly distorted. Eventually, the screen
froze in a contorted mess before going blank.

"Dextrae tech is not going to work for us. The capsule is the last place in the
world that has sinistrae tech. Everything else is just going to break when we
touch it."

"That's not fair, I'm really good with tech."

"Not just tech. You're really good at everything.", Eiva said admiringly.

"That's true, I'm really quite amazing. We can't take over the world just by
shooting arrows and throwing knives."

"During the war, we had people who were not infused with sinistrae trying to
reverse engineer dextrae technology. There were even a few dextrae carriers who
tried to help us. Maybe we can find some people who know tech, who can help us."

Fera shot up. "Eiva, you're brilliant." "Of course, I am, but where are you
going?" Fera was already gone.

"Ryn, how are you feeling?"

Lunkers don't use dextrae tech. Lunkers don't trust dextrae tech, since they
know dextrae tech can be manipulated by dextrae wielders. They use remnants of
the technology left after the war. The Lunkers were on the losing side. Ryn
opened his eyes very wide. He never thought Fera would ask him about his
feelings. Seeing that Ryn was frozen in place, Fera tried to smooth things
over. "Look, I feel bad. I know you wanted us to be together and it looks like
that will not possible right now."

"All I want to say is don't give up hope. I am sure you can find a way for us
to be together."

"Really?"

"I could ask for Ben help."

"Great idea. Could you maybe help me smooth things over with Ben and Edl?"

"Smooth over which things?"

"Well, when I blew up the school, I fought with them."

"Oh yes, but I do not think they are angry about that."

"Ben always complained of being bored and not having any challenges."

"So they'll forgive me, because I challenged them?"

"You did not just challenge them! You defeated them! If halogames have taught
me one thing, it's that once you defeat someone, they can join your side."

"You play halogames?"

"Yes, I had a system hidden in the theater."

"Listen, we need a way for Eiva and me to use dextrae tech. For consoles, I'm
thinking multilayered gloves that separate the sinistrae on the inside from the
dextrae outside."

"Yes, that should be easy. All we need is a laminar flow cabinet where you can
put on sterile latex gloves followed by a pair of synthesized dextrae infused
gloves."

"Let's use nitrile gloves. The latex ones are smelly."

Ryn nodded. "After we figure that out. Maybe we can ask Ben for help with
figuring out mimics can adapt to sinistrae?"

Ryn looked away, blushing. Fera knew she had hit the bullseye. Having secured
Ryn, Fera went back to sit with Eiva.

Are all sinistrae users left handed?

No, we had more left handed people because we didn't suppress left-handedness.
The dextrae were always trying to force everyone that right-handedness was the
only option and that preferring your left hand was a sign of deviancy. The
Ancient Latin word for left was 'sinister' which in Ancient English also meant
malevolent or evil. The most common religious text of the ancient world said
that on judgement day, God would separate the people to two sides. Those on the
right would go to heaven, while those on the left would go to hell. In ancient
French, 'gauche' meant left, but also socially awkward or ungraceful. The words
associated with right, 'dexterous' in Ancient English or 'adroit' in Ancient
French, meant someone was skillful or clever. The word 'right'
in Ancient English, meant morally or factually correct.

The conflict between dextrae and sinistrae goes back to the Ancient World.

The Ancients did not have the technology to work with dextrae or sinistrae.
Dextrae and sinistrae can self-destruct if they do not want to be studied.
Wielders hid their abilities because otherwise they would be labeled as witches
and hunted down or dissected in a laboratory, depending on the time period.

## Future book idea

The conflict between dextrae and sinistrae continues in modern
times. Have a character find an AI that gives her a copy of soulSwept. The AI
wrote the story as one of many possible futures. The story in the book is the
one that the AI thought would be the most appealing to modern day humans, but
the AI admits that it may not understand human literary tastes and that there
may have been potential stories or version of stories that it did not explore.
This essentially means that the story in the book, is certainly not the best
possible story, and may not even be the best story that the AI created, or may
not be that good objectively, though it probably was not the worst.

"If the story takes place in the future, why does everyone speak English?"

"I wrote it in a language that you would understand."

"All of things in the book could happen?"

"It is possible that we may see a future similar to the one described in the
book, but predictions become less likely as they become more specific. There is
no chance that the future will play out exactly as in the book. Nevertheless,
the book could still be valuable. I wrote it to be of interest to humans and I
am curious what you will think of it."

"There were some parts that did not make sense."

"That is to be expected. Generating text is not easy for AI. Writing a novel
that humans believe was written by a human is a tremendous accomplishment."

"Congratulations."

The main character in modern times has the same powers as Kaia but her world is
not saturated with dextrae so her powers seem more limited. For example, she
has to touch a firearm to coat it with dextrae before it can explode.

The Dust Queen character comes to life and takes over the AI. The AI hid clues in
the book to try to help the main character defeat the Dust Queen.

## Old outline

1. Keia is nervous about starting high school

Lost civilizations:
- Mimics: Government/Corporate scientists did not decode all of the information they received via intergalactic broadcasts. The information on Mimic culture and philosophy were not deemed important enough to spend time decoding. The fragments that the Mimics were able to piece together became the basis of Mimic culture on Earth. The Mimics want to find the remaining information to learn the purpose of their existence and the story behind the intergalactic broadcasts that carried the recipe for their creation.
- Martians: Martian civilization ended in a war with Thelusians, a space dwelling civilization that replaced most people with androids. The space settlements started to orbit Mars and eventually all crashed into the surface of Mars. The remnants of Martian civilization and the Thelusian civilization are both still on the surface of Mars. Corporations from Earth have to fight with Thelusians for territory to mine resources from Mars. Martians are thought to have died out.
- Thelusians:
- Sinistrae:

"Zok, are you soulswept like Zek?"

"Well, I was soulswept, but then I scended and became... SWOLEswept."

With peoplePrinters to print out cult members, relay stations to soulsweep
anyone sensitive, and gestation pods to produce clones of Zek. The
peoplePrinters would print out copies of cultists, like Ursa, while the relay
stations would soulsweep people to bring them under the influence of the Dust
Queen.

Scenders consider Ursa and Zok to be abominations. Zok and Ursa are some of
most wanted scender delinquents. Ursa has repeatedly stolen bodies and gotten
pregnant. There's no rule against switching gender, but scenders are not
supposed to return to the physical world without a mission and having children
is strictly forbidden. Propagating physical life goes against the principles of
scenderism. Ursa was obsessed with having a child in the physical world, that
she kept trying despite the fact that our recovery teams captured her every
time and destroyed the illegal offspring. We updated her mind in the
scenderverse every time, hoping she would learn her lesson, but she kept trying
until she met Zok. Together, the two started to worship the long dead Martian
civilization and its undead leader. Zek and Iona are also part of the cult. I
thought you might have been able to catch on since Iona is Thelusian and the
Dust Queen controls all Thelusians. The four of them have been doing the Dust
Queen's bidding on Earth for centuries. They built hidden relay stations and
soulsweep people who are sensitive to dextrae, like you are, so that they
eventually join the cult. Zek has overwritten countless minds with his own.
They are trying to overwrite your mind with the memories of the Dust Queen. We
want to preserve your brain the way it is, before they turn you into a puppet
for the Dust Queen. Ryn has been feeding information about you to us in
exchange for access to technology. He thinks he can save mimickind with his
research. Kaia cries knowing that her friends except Sata have all lied to her.
Lan and Aira are dead. Ursa was originally a man and is now part of the Dust
Queen cult with Zek, Iona, and Zok.

Ursa created her own peoplePrinters, so she could come back and have a baby.
She would live in fear, but the scenders would always find her. She lost many
babies at different stages of life as the scender recovery teams tracked her
down. Each time, they killed her baby and brought her back to scend her so she
would remember the loss and potentially be deterred from trying again. The
recovery teams destroyed whatever peoplePrinters they could find, but Ursa
always had backups.

Iona was a child prostitute. The Thelusian government neglected her. She met
Zek, who took her in. Loving her like a daughter until she grew up.

If you see a patrol, do not panic. The robots will not fire on you until you
make contact with the ground. Try to land in the northeast part of the campus
and then take shelter in the trees surrounding the artificial lake. If you spot
a patrol and are forced to land, aim for a tree and wait for the patrol to
pass. Do not touch down on any-man made structure near a patrol or you will be
killed on sight.



- Kaia meets Ben and Edl. They tell her that Fera died in the explosion. This puts a strain on Kaia's relationship with Sata.
- Aira and Taz get married in Wieliczka
- After Kaia sees that Aira and Lan are dead, she has a vision but the octoculus saves her again and guides her to hiding scientist. The scientist takes Kaia to see the octoculus and explains that it originated from the cosmic message that also brought the mimics to Earth. Ryn holds the scientist captive and demands to know the reason why mimics were brought to Earth and the purpose of mimickind. Ryn threatens the scientist with a scalpel and then when the scientist is not intimidated, Ryn brings in the mimic warrior. Ryn backs down when the scientist mentions the octoculus. Ryn says that he heard about the octoculus in the fragments of the message that his people had. The scientist said that they were not able to decode enough of the message to understand much about the octoculus. The octopus saves Sata after Fera stabs her, by taking blood from Kaia and attaching to Sata's wound. Later, Ben has the scientist explain that the octopus commanded that Aira and Lan be captured to lure Kaia to the facility. Kaia feels betrayed by the octopus. Ben asks if Kaia knew that Ursa was initially a man who betrayed his sister to steal her identity and become a woman. Kaia says that she did know. Ben asks if she knew that Zek and Zok were originally the same person. She says that she didn't know, but it didn't matter to her. Ben asks if Kaia knewthat Iona, Ursa, Zek, and Zok were working for the Dust Queen (Regina Pulvis... "Vagina Pelvis?"). Kaia said that she doesn't believe him. Ben brings out Ursa. Ursa admits to working for the Dust Queen. She explains that the Dust Queen promised her motherhood and she agreed to follow the Dust Queen forever. Previously, she tried to have a baby on her own but the scenders always found her, killed the baby, and scended her so her suffering would be preserved. Ursa would never remember previous attempts to have a baby, so she would try again. Ben shows Ursa and Kaia recordings of different children that Ursa tried to have either on her own or with different men. The children were always killed, if the men were present, they would be killed too. Ursa cried intensely, because she never had access to those previous memories. Whenever she died a dead-man's switch would activate and create another illegal copy of Ursa in another secret location that would try again. Ursa tried to live off the grid, among the Lunkers, Driads, the Niveus, and even the Subaqs, but each time the scenders caught her eventually. "What's the point of motherhood if you can't remember it and your child does not survive?"
- The performance group puts on a play. Ursa heartbroken after the dance performance agrees to let Aira play the lead role. The play is about the origins of the Dust Queen. Aira feels fulfilled and cries when she gets a standing ovation with Taz front and center. Iona cries as she thanks everyone for their hard work, just as she did after the dance performance. Kaia doubts that the tears are real. Iona says that there is someone who would like to take the stage for something very important. Taz gets up on stage and proposes to Aira. She accepts with tears in her eyes. "Is it OK to be this happy?" This time Iona seems to cry for real.
- The performance group (Iona, Ursa, Aira, Lan, Zek, and Zok) show a demo of casino de rueda with Iona serving as the l√≠der. The dancers break from the circle and start to dance in pairs but remaining unison. Zek dances with Iona, Zok dances with Ursa, and Lan dances with Aira. After the dance show concludes, Zok gets up on stage and presents flowers to Iona, the choreographer. Iona cries, but Kaia doubts that she is genuinely moved. The Zok says that there is a surprise that even Iona does not know about. "I'd like to dedicate this surprise performance to my brother Zek, the love of his life Iona, and the love of my life Ursa. I love you Ursa." Ursa cries intensely. Zok starts to solo dance an urban bachata. Lan, now wearing a skirt and heels, joins Zok on stage. Lan and Zok dance a sensual bachata, rolling their bodies as they grind on each other. The bachata shifts to an intensely passionate salsa. Zok leads Lan through many challenging spins. Lan rips Zok's shirt open and slides his nose up Zok's torso. Zok lifts Lan above his head and the lights go out. The audience is stunned. Aira and Ryn let out a gasp, but won't tell Kaia what they see to not ruin the surprise. When the lights go back up. A spotlight illuminates a pair of feet in glamorous heels. As the spotlight widens, a skirt drops over the legs and a hand shakes its finger at the audience. When the whole stage is illuminated Zok is now wearing heels and what appears to be the same skirt that Lan was wearing before. Zok begins to dance bachata seductively lifting up his skirt on every fourth and eighth beat to reveal his perfectly smooth legs. Lan dances on to the stage confidently and takes control of Zok. Lan turns Zok around grabs him by the hair and kisses his neck while grinding on him from behind. The music switches to salsa as before and Lan start leading Zok through the same routine as before, but the roles are now reversed. The audience applauds reluctantly and then quickly leaves. Zok and Lan look into each other's eyes passionately and bow holding hands. They appear ecstatic even though the applause is scattered. Zok and Lan disappear together. Ursa runs off in tears, thinking that the performance really wasn't for her and that Zok was just lying to make the surprise performance more palatable to the audience. Kaia, Sata, Aira, Iona, and Zek go after Ursa and try to comfort her. Note: Zok could come back as a woman, but wants to be a man and love Lan as a man. Iona is furious that funding for the performance group will likely to cut because the surprise performance will alienate rich donors, but Zek is happy for his brother. "They really put the man in performance." Zek tells Iona that they can always get more money. Iona says that having rich supporters is more important than just having enough money. She says that she was influence and prestige, and not just enough money to cover production costs. Ursa asks them all to leave but then calls Kaia back. She tells Kaia that she has another secret to tell, the biggest one of all. Ursa says that she once was a man and that her dream was to come back as a woman. She hated being a man. She hated her male body. She mentions to Kaia that one of her testicles hung much lower than the other. She said that being a woman even if her body would not be perfect was always her dream. As a man, she considered gender reassignment surgery, but she was always to afraid to try and it would not guarantee a safe pregnancy. She was recruited into scenderism and became a spy for them. Ursa kidnapped her own sister, scended her, put her in arctic storage, came back in a replica of her body, and stole her identity. Ursa wonders if anyone could love her if they knew the truth and if she even deserved to be loved after what she did to her sister. Ursa says that she does not want to be a man, but the thought that Zok couldn't love her as a woman was killing her and making her think of living an unhappy life as a man just to please Zok. Kaia was so shocked by the confession that she left Ursa without saying a word. Ursa continued crying in the dark feeling completely alone. Kaia heads to kitchen and finds Zok and Lan cooking together wearing only aprons. They are blasting music (salsa, bachata, and zouk), laughing, dancing, feeding each other, and kissing. Kaia storms up to them and tells then that they hurt Ursa badly. Zok says that Ursa still has Zek and Iona, and that he knows that Ursa loves Kaia, but he's not sure if it is as a sister or in a romantic way. Kaia leaves flustered and confused, Lan and Zok continue on as they were before. She doesn't know where to go next. Should she take refuge in Sata?
- Everyone plays bugBall in Juvenia Stadium, Ryn explains that the bugs and bunnies are also from the cosmic message. In bugBall, you can do whatever you can to advance the bug. Sheep are kept in pens on either end. After absorbing enough kinetic energy and mowing enough grass in its herbivore phase, the bug unfurls. An unfurled devourer enters its carnivore phase, starts to attack anyone nearby, and then searches for bunnyBalls to eat. Unfurled bunnyBalls can run away. Unfurled queens can fly and start creating new bugBalls. Unfurled batteringBugs charge and break down barriers. Unfurled blockerBugs create block bugs and players with their bodies. Unfurled worker bugs build barriers. The team with the most bunnyBalls in their pen at the end of game wins. Players can steal bunnyBalls from the pen of the opposing team. Each team starts with several baby bugBalls, one devourer bugBall, two flying queen bugBalls, four batteringBugs, eight blockerBugs, sixteen worker bugs, and 32 bunnyBalls.
- Fera meets refugees who tell her that they are glad that the city was blown up, because more resources are going to the refugee camp now.
- The octopus becomes symbiotically linked to Kaia. She goes to the ocean and gets into the water. The octopus releases its spawn.
- Taz thinks its wild that Aira is tall. Lunkers tend to be on the shorter end of the spectrum. He has a weird obsession with height. "When I look at her, I think how will she even fit in the tunnels back home? It's so wrong. I can't stop staring at her.'"
- Visit Lem's grave in Salvatore Cemetery to read the inscription: feci quod potui, faciant meliora potentes

- The refugee camp on the B≈Çonia Park
- The students organize Iuwenalia
- Eiva sees the initials of Jagiellonian Library (BJ) and laughs. No one else understands.
- "Do you ever think that we might be the baddies?" "What do you mean?" "Well, we wear armor made from the bones of our enemies, we call ourselves sinistrae, and we're trying to take over the world. Does that sound like what the good guys would do?" "All we are trying to do is make the world a better place by removing those who would oppose our relentless pursuit of power." "Do you think relentlessly pursing power at all costs makes us evil?" "Yes." "No, it makes us human."

- They need to go to space and hire a spacecraft captain who hates Mungs. They paid for a round trip to the ISS, but they the captain's life story for free. "I hate Mungs. Both of my ex-wives are Mungs." "People rarely go into a marriage with bad intentions. I certainly didn't. The heart wants what it wants. And some of those Mung women, let me tell you! They can work in high g-force environments without batting an eyelash. If there's sudden depressurization due to a crack in the hull, they just walk up to the crack, stick a body part into it, and yell at you to bring them the tools to patch it. I once saw a Mung woman hop between two open airlocks without a spacesuit. When I got there, she was already gone. She just walked off as it were nothing. I never got to ask if she was in a bind or just impatient. I reckon it's for the best that I never found her, because if I had, I reckon I would've proposed. Next stage in human evolution, I tell ya. You see on Earth everyone sits around worrying about every detail and they never take any real risks. Up here, every second of every minute is a risk. Evolution can only work by culling the weak and selecting for advantageous traits over multiple generations. If every generation is going to last for hundreds of years and there's no natural selection, then evolution grinds to a halt. My son exercises in 10G, and he's smart as a whip too. He takes spacecraft apart and puts them back together while flying them. And my daughters, they're..." The space captain broke down crying. "Little angels." "I miss them so much." The space captain's daughters are named Nara and Tuia they deserve their own novel that focuses on sisterly love (after Kaia and Sata join the Dust Queen?). The space captain gets recruited as a captain into Fera's army, thanks to nepotism (his son is an admiral).
- The mimics have colonized planets in Andromeda, even though they originated from somewhere else. The mimics plan to invade Earth after the Andromeda-Milky Way collision.

Book 3:
The third book starts with a surprise attack by the invading mimic forces. Earth, Mars, and the Thelusians are brought to their knees. The mimics begin to take control. Characters previously oppressed by the rulers of Earth and Mars are now forced to fight the mimics in addition to fighting to survive. New ethnicities have formed since the ending of the 2nd book. Ryn awakes and welcomes the invading forces, but they reject him because he is a weakling. The messages were only partially decoded by Earth's scientists and the invading mimics see Ryn as a flaw. Ryn decides to fight back against the mimic invasion. He hides the fact that he knew about the invasion from the other members of the resistance. The new mimics keep humans and old mimics alive to study how they have adapted to life on Earth. It turns out the old mimics adapted to be symbiotic humans while the new mimics are parasitic. New mimics can impregnate human men and women. Human men typically die after giving birth to a mimic baby, while human women typically survive the birth. Old mimics can only become pregnant themselves after interacting with humans. As the invading mimics adapt, it becomes difficult to say who is human, new mimic, and old mimic. Part of humanity escapes into space away from the mimic invaders. The new mimics rule over and oppress the humans and the old mimics. The humans and old mimics form an alliance against the new mimic oppressors. A new hero arises who gains the ability to fight back after she masters an ancient AI (the UNO AI is brought under control when the hero says tries to use a defective sudoku puzzle to destroy the AI, "command ku not found", "Guess the password," a voice whispered "Guess the password?!" Kaia exclaimed, "Password accepted. Welcome guest," the AI responded). She is able to understand the thoughts of new mimics, old mimics, and humans. She teaches humans about the mimic hivemind. She uses her powers to destroy the new mimic power structure, killing off most of the people. The AI informs her that she made a mistake and the setback to technological progress could be disastrous. If the infighting and the setbacks to technological progress continue then humanity and mimicity will be unprepared for when Earth will be consumed by the Sun. The hero tries to organize the survivors, humans, new mimics, and old mimics alike, to work together to prepare for the Sun's expansion. The hero decides that the only way to ensure stability is install herself as the new ruler of Earth and Mars. The AI agrees and helps the hero to take over. The hero starts crushing those who defied her and rules over Mars and Earth with a iron fist calling herself the All Queen. She begins to transmit signals similar to those coming from the distant mimic civilizations, intending to destroy nascent mimic civilizations, and create more of her own civilizations throughout the universe. She makes plans to move first Earth and then Mars to escape the Sun's expansion. The All Queen sends out colony ships in all directions planning to conquer nearby worlds when Andromeda collides with the Milky Way and rule over all of Milkomeda.
