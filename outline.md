After they leave on their stags, Fera asks questions and Ryn confesses his love for her. They arrive at the Lunker city. They meet Nil and Oil. Fera thinks the boat ride is a trap, but decides to go anyway. Nil and Oil act as tour guides. Fera enjoys the boat ride with Ryn, even though she does not want to admit it. The boat is pulled between the two sides of the lake by a rope. The water level drops until the boat is on the bottom of a ravine. A door opens. After going through the door, Ryn gets sick and his body abandons preparation for pregnancy causing him to bleed. Fera drags Ryn outside and then goes back in to look for help. She encounters an AI. The AI explains sinistrae and introduces Fera to Eiva, who immediately hit it off. Fera forgets about Ryn. Fera and Eiva climb out and then lower a rope to Ryn. Fera is suprised that she can climb so well. She thinks Ryn is extremely light, but the truth is she has become extremely strong. The AI closes the lake to visitors and only gives Fera and Eiva access. On the train to the refugee camp, Fera is angered when Ryn continues to cry over losing the pregnancy and feeling sick in the presence of Fera and Eiva. Fera and Eiva move away from Ryn. They snuggle up together. What the hell is this romantic subplot bullshit? Fera says she feels weird sleeping next to Eiva. Eiva tells her to shut up and enjoy it, which Fera does.
- 05: Finally fitting in
  - Kaia, Sata, Lan, Aira, Zek, Zok, Ursa, Iona, and Taz settle into the refugee camp built between the ruins of the ancient cities of Oswiecim and Brzezinka. Each protagonist has a job/activity, e.g. Lan works in the kitchen and Taz guards the camp. The theater group puts a show. Kaia convinces Ursa and her understudy and dunderstudy to pretend to be sick. To prevent any questions, they tell everyone that all three were kissing each other. Aira was not invited to the kissing party, because she is with Taz. Aira performs in front of Taz and the entire refugee camp and is extremely moved by how well the show goes. She thanks Kaia and Ursa. Kaia gets beat up by Pyr and his posse. Everyone visits Kaia in the hospital. Zek, Zok, Ursa, Iona, and Sata stay with Kaia all night in the hospital. Kaia goes to sleep with Sata stroking her hair and holding her hand.
- 06: A great way to make friends
  - Eiva, Fera, and Ryn arrive and visit Kaia in the hospital. Fera finds Pyr to take revenge, she tells him that his father is alive, but then breaks his arms and legs and tells him not to mess with Kaia ever again. Pyr winds up in the hospital bed next to Kaia. He apologizes to Kaia and says that he was paid by someone to beat up Kaia, but he does not know who it was. Fera beats everyone in arm wrestling. Ryn asks Ben for help with inoculating against sinistrae. Ben and Ryn begin to study the sinistrae injections that Eiva and Fera brought. Taz tries an injection, notices that it messes with equipment, but starts taking the injections when off duty as part of a tech detox, he feels incredibly strong, energetic, virile. Taz has sex with Aira but Aira gets sick from his use of the sinistrae injections, she convinces him to stop. He agrees to stop for the good of the baby. Aira and Taz fall asleep together. Aira is kidnapped in her sleep. Taz interrogates her. She doesn't admit that she is a mimic. Taz injects her with the sinistrae and recoils in horror as her skin turns pitch black, she grows membranes, and her feet sprout roots. Lan is abducted from the kitchen. The government shows up in Ben's workshop but he saves Ryn by giving him an empty injection. Kaia talks with Taz and he is indifferent about Aira saying she lied to him. He refuses to help rescue Aira. He hates being in uniform and uses sinistrae injections when off duty. Taz snitches on the protagonists and they have to escape the refugee camp. Ben, Edl, Zek, Zok, Ursa, Iona, Fera, Eiva, Kaia, Sata, and Ryn plan to rescue Aira and Sata.
  - End: Kaia is moved to the infirmary of an airship that the protagonists are taking to the site where Aira and Lan are being held. Kaia and Sata sleep next to each other. Kaia is still hurt. The chapter ending contrasts Fera and Eiva with Kaia and Sata. In combat, Fera and Eiva are fighters, while Kaia and Sata play support roles. Sata likes light-hearted humor that may be a bit naughty, while Fera likes brutal, offensive, lewd humor. Sata gets really into jokes, Kaia plays more of a supportive role. No one understands Eiva's humor because she is a relic. Fera and Eiva do not care about the feelings and the well being of others. Kaia and Sata are more delicate, empathic, and conscientious.
- 07: A touching reunion
  - The protagonists infiltrate the government facility. They move in stealthily, Sata helps Kaia walk, because Kaia is still hurt. The protagonists are bathed in spotlights and surrounded by heavily armed soldiers. They surrender and are shocked into submission but when Kaia sees Sata being shocked and is shocked herself, she has a vision of the mummy queen and destroys all of the soldiers' weapons and powersuits killing them all. Everyone is impressed with Kaia's power, but Kaia is horrified by what she did. Ben is scientifically interested in Kaia's power. Eiva says that Kaia's power would have changed the outcome of the dextrae-sinistrae war. As they search for Lan and Aira, they are attacked by GES. Kaia blinds the GES but they find their opponents with echolocation and use screams to incapacitate anyone within range. When they scream, they cannot use echolocation, because they have to close their sensitive ears. Kaia, Sata, and Ryn find a child covered in blood who looks exactly like Lan. They find Lan's body and see that Lan recently gave birth to the child who is a mimic warrior. Lan had been starved for a long time, his skin was black, his membranes was extended to catch the light, and his feet had sprouted roots. Lan had been partially eaten by the mimic child. The blood covering the child was Lan's. Ryn says that it should be impossible for Lan to produce a mimic warrior in such a short time and that the child is because of government experiments. The child looks exactly like a childlike Lan. They take the child with them. Their hidden airship is destroyed by an airstrike and the base is surrounded by giant robots. A soldier with a gigaphone tells them surrender or they will destroy the base with airstrikes. Everyone tries to convince Kaia to use her power, but she does not want to kill anyone else. She is still shocked by the fact that Aira and Lan are dead. Fera finds an intact stunStaff and shocks Kaia. The stunStaff malfunctions from Fera's sinistrae. Sata tries to stop Fera. The protagonists fight. The sinistrae are evenly matched against the dextrae, because Zek cannot blind them and the sinistrae sap the strength of Zok, Ursa, and Iona. Ursa and Zok are not able to wield energy effectively. The blows they land are absorbed by the bone armor that Eiva and Fera wear. Zek tries to land a blow with his knives and snakes, but Eiva and Fera are stronger and faster. While everyone is distracted, Ben uses another stunStaff on Kaia and studies her response. Edl holds Sata and Ryn back, because Ben told him to do so. Sata cries as Kaia is shocked repeatedly. The stunStaff explodes, blowing off Ben's hand. Kaia, as the Mummy Queen, destroys all of the giant robots and the protagonists are buried in rubble as the building collapses when the giant robot fuel cells detonate.
- 08: Honesty is the best policy
  - Ben and Edl's parents rescue the protagonists, but Ben decides to scend Kaia while keeping everyone else captive. He explains his motives. Ben wants to convince scenders that physical life is useless. Ben says that he needs Kaia to be conscious while he scends her and that it would be best if she cooperated. He explains that scenders cannot forget anything ever and that if she experiences pain during the scending she will remember it forever. He takes Kaia into a chamber where the fuel cells are very far away, supposedly out of range. Ben operates the console with one hand, though he says he can grow himself another hand. Kaia tries to channel the Mummy Queen but she cannot. She resigns to her fate when she see Sata next to her. Sata controls Ben and has him release her. Sata loses control of Ben and Edl attack Kaia. Ben thinks that Kaia took control of him. Kaia blinds Ben and Edl, but she cannot open the doors. Ben refuses to let her out and laughs at her feeble attempt to escape. In a panic, Kaia slaps Ben in the face. He laughs at how weak her slap was, but then starts to scream as his skin burns in the place where Kaia slapped him. She tells him that the burning will continue until he lets her and everyone else go. Ben says that he can handle the pain but the burn is disintegrating his skin. He continues to resist until he loses half of his face and his jaw becomes unhinged. Kaia is horrified by when she has done. Ben then opens the door and shows her footage of her friends being released. She takes Ben as a hostage and leaves Edl blind and screaming for her blood, because she hurt his brother. The protagonists go to steal an airship to escape but the airships are gone and Ben and Edl's parents are there waiting for them with an army of scenders. They explain that they do not plan to let Kaia go. They say they can always print another Ben. They say that he was right that Kaia was valuable. They do not blame him for betraying them just to get the burning pain to stop. Ben cries, but he cannot talk because the bottom right side of his face is melted. Kaia and Zek blind the scenders but the protagonists are overwhelmed by the sheer volume of scenders. The scenders pile up on the protagonists and are about to take them captive. Kaia wants to surrender. Fera asks why Kaia wants to surrender all the time, here and the base. Fera stabs Sata and as Sata bleeds out, Kaia channels the Mummy Queen and kills all of the scenders, but cannot harm Fera. The Mummy Queen is furious that there is someone who she cannot kill. The Mummy Queen lashes out at Fera, but she an invisible shield protects Fera. The Mummy Queen slams against the invisible barrier until she dissipates. Eiva and Fera stabilize Sata by infusing her with sinistrae blood. They leave Ben because he has no value as a hostage. Ryn guides them underground and the protagonists (Sata, Kaia, Eiva, Fera, Zek, Zok, Ursa, Iona, and Ryn) head to Wessel lake in Wieliczka to hide from the scenders.
- 09: Home sweet home
  - Fera and Eiva take Sata into the silo and infuse her with self-replicating sinistrae. Kaia is haunted by visions of the Mummy Queen, but the visions subside when Kaia enters the silo. No one else can enter the silo because they are all dextrae based. Ursa and Ryn both start to have terrible abdominal cramps and begins to cry uncontrollably. Iona starts to glitch. Zok begins to wield energy and blows off both of his hands. The mimic warrior goes wild and starts to lash and bite everyone randomly. Zek seems to go insane, loses control, and blinds everyone except Kaia, Sata, Eiva, and Fera. Zek's snakes writhe in pain. Kaia leaves the others because she is mostly concerned with Sata. Fera is unsure of why Kaia does not appear to have any negative reactions to sinistrae. Kaia stays in the silo with Sata. Sata is unconsious and Kaia has the first dreamless sleep in her life. The others are left in the dark at the bottom of Lake Wessel. After they recover, they (Zek, Ursa, Ryn, and Iona) rush to get Zok to a Lunker hospital. They (Zek, Zok, Ursa, Ryn, and Iona) are captured by scenders who followed them into the tunnels. The scenders detonate explosives to collapse the tunnels in Wieliczka burying Kaia, Sata, Fera, and Eiva alive.
- 10: Nothing interesting happens
  - Kaia takes sinistrae supplements to survive, while they dig themselves out. They are starving, because Fera hides food for Eiva who is revealed to be pregnant. They fill the silo with rubble as they dig their way out. The AI still has a connection to the internet and hires miners to dig through to the silo. Eiva gives birth and Kaia is near death from starvation when the miners break through. Fera and Eiva start to organize an army to defeat the scenders. Kaia and Sata get ready to rescue Zek, Zok, Ursa, Ryn, and Iona from the scenders. Mel joins them with druidicDryad warriors. Taz joins Fera's army with some army buddies who are also addicted to sinistrae. Kaia is angry at Taz, but Fera accepts him with open arms. Representatives of various oppressed people start to visit Fera, e.g. Daka and Dzaa from the Mungs. They hatch a plan to rescue Zek, Zok, Ursa, Iona, and Ryn. When Kaia arrives to save her friends, she is surprised that there is no resistance. When she finds her friends, sees that Zek, Zok, Ursa, Iona, and Ryn have made a deal with the scenders (to create a child with Kaia's powers. Zek and Zok agree because they see an opportunity to realize their dream of bringing back their ancient offspring and reclaiming Mars) and are living comfortable. They say that the scenders mean her no harm and that Ursa is pregnant and that scenders are taking care of them and that they do not want to leave. Kaia bonds with the child while it is still in the womb. She forgets about Fera and Sata (Eiva stayed behind with the baby). Sata decides to stay with Kaia. Fera is furious with all of them but she calls her army back. Ryn stays. Even though Ryn still is in love with Fera, he knows she does not love him back and that he cannot go inside the silo. The baby starts to destroy the sinistrae in Sata and Kaia's systems. Sata starts to experience seizures again and Kaia's visions return much stronger than before. Fera visits them and starts bringing them sinistrae injections which they have to use more and more frequently, as the baby becomes stronger. Ryn professes his love for Kaia and Sata. He says he can concieve a child for them that will be carry a mix of their DNA with his. Kaia and Sata accept Ryn as their surrogate mother and stop the sinistrae injections so Ryn can get pregnant. Fera is a bit jealous that Ryn has shifted his affection to Sata and Kaia, but hides it and says that if they do not want the sinistrae injections that she will stop bringing them, but she hopes that she can still visit. Sata and Kaia says that of course Fera can visit and that she can also bring Eiva and her baby when she visits. Life becomes very hard for Sata and Kaia without the sinistrae injections, as the baby grows stronger, their conditions become worse. When the baby is born Sata starts having so many absentee seizures that she is immobilized. Kaia lives in two worlds simultaneously: on Earth with the baby and on Mars with the Mummy Queen, who is overjoyed with the birth of her offspring. Ryn gives birth to his child with Sata and Kaia, a girl who looks like all three of them. The live happily for a while before the baby girl dies. The baby girl is an angel and does not need to be fed milk because she can photosynthesize. The girl grows up along side the boy until he kills her when he gets jealous of Kaia's motherly love being split between the two of them. Sata is distraught and her condition worsens. Kaia grieves by focusing on her baby son. Fera takes Sata back to the silo for recovery. When Sata returns she seems much better but soon she gets very sick. Fera tries to administer sinistrae medicine but it does not help. Zek, Zok, and Ryn cannot cure Sata so they help Sata scend before she dies.

 When Sata returns in a newly printed body everything again seems fine, but during a training session with Zok and Ursa, Sata kills both of the simultaneously, blowing off both of their heads along with her hands. Zek and Iona attack, but Kaia causes Iona to freeze as she begs them all to stop fighting. The sinistrae warriors (Fera, Mel, Taz, etc.) kill Zek and tear off Iona's head. Kaia is left with her baby, the insane Lita, Fera and her sinistrae warriors, and Iona's disembodied head. Kaia moves into a cottage near Wieliczka. Ryn stays with her. Iona's head keeps Kaia company. Fera, Eiva, and their daughter come to visit. Ryn tells Kaia about Fera's deception. Kaia escapes with Ryn, her baby, and Iona's head. They settle into a new normal, but then they are attacked by Ben and Edl. Kaia kills them by throwing them off a cliff and watching mimic sharks eat them. The intensification of the visions force Kaia back to the cottage. Fera has constructed a Palace of bone (supposedly the ones of her vanquished foes) next to the cottage.
- 11: Take your time
  - Kaia has a vision of Sata and is able to communicate with her thanks to her son. Kaia resolves to bring back Sata no matter the cost. Fera consolidates power over Earth and plans her invasion of Mars. Fera explains that Kaia is integral to her plans of conquering Mars. Ryn promises to help Kaia, because he is in love with both Sata and Kaia. Iona promises to help Kaia bring back Sata if they also bring back Zek, Zok, and Ursa. Kaia agrees.

## Trunderstudy

"What's a trunderstudy?"

"A triple understudy. It is like a vice president, or rather a vice vice vice
president.", Aira explained, counting on her fingers with each "vice". "If
something happens to the lead performer, the understudy, and the dunderstudy,
then I have to be ready to take over, so that the show can go on."

## Eiva's daughter

"Look at what she can do.", Eiva proudly gesturing towards her daughter.
Fera looked in amazement as the skeleton in front of them danced.

"She can move it with her mind? Did you know she could do that?", Fera asked.

"Throw a bone knife at my face."

"What? No!"

"Fine, aim at my stomach. If I can't block it, you can always stitch up me
afterwards, but I'm not in any danger, because you throw like a girl."

Fera's favorite activity other than skating was throwing rocks. Whenever she
was too tired to skate, she would spend hours throwing rocks at abandoned
buildings. Throwing rocks was an outlet for the anger that Fera felt.

"Come on! Let's see what that noodle arm can do. I bet you can't even reach
me!"

Fera did not need any further encouragement. She threw a bone knife straight at
Eiva's chest.

Eiva did not move a muscle, but the knife got knocked away in mid-air.

"I was the best sinistrae wielder during the war. Changing the paths of thrown
bone knives was my specialty. Too bad I couldn't deflect dextrae bullets during
the war."

"With Kaia, we don't need to deflect the bullets. She can blow up all of their
weapons. If the blasts don't kill them, our arrows and knives will."

## Civilizations:

- Cacumina (topsiders)
- Martians
- Thelusians
- Scenders
- druidicDryads
- Atlantans
- Zeppelinomads
- Mimics
- Mungs
- Lunkers

## Names:

- Female names are created from given name, mother's name, maternal grandmother's
(waipo's) name, e.g. Kaia, Kela, Aila
- Male names are created from given name,
father's name, paternal grandfather's (yeye's) name, e.g. Zek, Ian, Rov

Girls take their mother's last name, while boys take their fathers last name.

Zek and Zok are not actually twins. Danilo created Echo and Scender versions of
himself. The Echo version, Zek, was born to a surrogate mother that Danilo
hired and then conditioned with Danilo's mind using Echo tech. The Scender
version, Zok, was printed from a scan of a previous Echo's mind. Zek fights in
a mixed style, while Zok is pure melee tank. Zek pretends to be Iona's
boyfriend, while Zok pretends to be Ursa's boyfriend. In reality, they are all
polyamorous. Zek fixes Iona when she needs repair and tries to make sure she is
comfortable. Zok tries to keep Ursa entertained. Zok is more muscular and
better looking than Zek while Zek is more nerdy and tech savvy. Kaia meets Zek
and Zok (the twins as Lan introduces them) on the airship. The airship crashes
because Kaia has a dream about the Mummy Queen destroying the fuel cell, which
results in the fuel cell actually exploding in real life. Zek and Zok are
responsible for the Echo dreams that Kaia experiences. They are secretly amazed
by Kaia's ability to destroy fuel cells and decide to encourage her to develop
this talent. They tell Kaia that she was responsible for the airship, she is
dismayed, but they tell her that she can learn to control her power. The power
to destroy fuel cells comes in handy when they go to rescue Aira and Lan.

## Martian book
Anyone non-Echo who looks at the text in the book loses the ability to breathe.
Only by understanding Martian text can someone look at the book's text and survive.

## Combat
The first time we see major combat is when everyone sets out to rescue Aira and
Lan.

Edl, Ursa, Zok, and Iona are tanks
Kaia, Ben, and Sata are ranged
Zek and the sinistrae (Fera, Eiva, and Mel) are mixed
Taz refuses to come, because he says that Aira lied to him

Sata is mostly useful as a scout. Ryn in useless at all times. Ben is fairly
useless with his robotic birds, because Kaia can blow up any animalAutomatons
before Ben can hack them. Ben is mostly good for scouting with his birds,
opening doors, and accessing schematics. The major advantage is provided by
Kaia who causes energy weapons and exoskeleton armor power suits to explode.
The government soldiers who remove their energy-powered gear and avoid the
explosions are left with only combat knives. None of the characters are immune
to the combat knives, so there is still real danger, but their powers allow
them to quickly defeat the government soldiers. For example, the government
soldiers are not able to fight effectively when Kaia and Zek blind and
disorient them. To keep the battles from being one-sided, the protagonists
split up. How should they split up? Anyone who Kaia, has no problem. Without
Kaia, Zek and the sinistrae have to use stealth and the tanks have to use
lightning fast offense. The government facilities also contain genetically
engineered soldiers (GES) with pangolin armor plating growing on their bodies.
The GES can use echo location to find their foes, so they can continue fighting
even after Echos blind them. The Scender tanks have trouble defeating the GES,
so the sinistrae get to show off their powers. In comparison with the regular
government soldiers, all Echos, Sinistrae, and Scenders seem really OP. The
final battle is against a giant robot with a fuel cell that Kaia cannot explode
because it would destroy the entire facility. Instead Kaia destroys anything on
the robot that has an independent fuel cell, e.g. gun turrets. The scender
tanks (Edl, Ursa, and Zok) and sinistrae (Fera, Eiva, and Mel) have to team up
to destroy the giant robot. Zek is useless against it. Ben tries to hack it.
Is Sata a sinistrae at this point? I think she shouldn't be.

  - Can cause all dextrae fuel cells to explode, destroying animalAutomatons, exoskeleton powersuits, energy weapons, etc.
    - Destruction of energy weapons shifts the balance in combat between dextrae and sinistrae
    - In normal ranged combat, it is dextrae bullets versus sinistrae arrows
    - With energy weapons, dextrae who can pin the sinistrae down with endless suppressing fire
    - Without energy weapons, dextrae have no firepower, but sinistrae arrows still work
    - Once energy weapons are destroyed, Sinistrae no longer have to use stealth to avoid dextrae bullets
    - Fuel cells explosion can kill or maim Dextrae, those who survive have to fight sinistrae in melee combat while avoiding sinistrae arrows
- Ben:
  - Fast on smooth terrain when wearing powerskates
  - Can control all animalAutomatons and later gun turrets and orbital lasers
    - After being capturing by Ben, Kaia makes Ben destroy half his building with an orbital laser, so she can escape when Zek and Ursa come to rescue her
  - Extremely sensitive to Kaia's Echo powers of making fuel cells exploded, because all of his tech contains fuel cells
  - Tech genius

## Parents
Kaia and Sata miss their parents (who are they?).
Fera misses her mom, not her abusive father.
Zek, Zok, Ursa, Ryn, Aira, Lan, and Iona do not have living parents.
Ben and Edl have great relationships with their parents who try to hide the fact that Edl was synthesized by Ben when he was a child.
Dzaa and Daka's parents are in space.
Taz and Mel are adults.

## Ryn
Ryn gets pregnant from Fera. When she discovers sinistrae, Ryn miscarries. He
is heartbroken and cannot be near her again, so he tries to invent a way to
inoculate mimics against sinistrae and eventually adapt their reproductive
systems to sinistrae. He fails to create the inoculation and later falls in
love with Kaia.

## Mungs

Intro two new characters named Dzaa and Daka. Aka is a Mung girl who needs
exoskeletons to move around on earth because she suffers from osteogeneza
imperfecta and her bones are brittle and weak after a lifetime in space. Dzaa
is a Mung girl who grew up on a spacecraft that was spinning wildly out of
control. After a lifetime of being exposed to extreme G forces, Dzaa became
extremely strong, the exact opposite of Aka. Dzaa falls for Edll, because he is
the only man she has seen who can rival her strength. Ben takes an interest in
Daka's exoskeleton, which she built herself in space (a throwback to his
earlier interest in Fera). The Mung people are named after the Mung beans that
they grow in space as a protein source for Earth. The Mungs consist of various
ethnicities that were driven into space when larger, more powerful neighbours
took over their land. The Mungs believe that Tengri, the sky god, saved them
from conflict on Earth by accepting them into the sky. The government views
them as space parasites and promotes several stereotypes and misconceptions
regarding Mungs, e.g. that they use their babies to plug holes in their
spacecraft. Mungs fight with prisoners sent to space. The government does not
recognize Mungs as a people. Mungs want a sovereign nation. The government
cracks down on any political activity and indiscriminately destroyed Mung ships
before but had stopped since the Mungs learn to throw space rocks at Earth with
great precision. Currently, there is a stalemate.

Dzaa and Daka are sent to Earth to talk with Fera after the Mung people she her
success as CEO of Reli Corp and connect it to the recording of Fera's protest.

The girls plead with Fera to help the Mungs gain sovereignty from the government.

Fera tells that them after the revolution, there will be freedom for everyone,
even Mungs.

"and Lunkers." Ryn added cautiously.

"Yes, Lunkers and Mungs."

"What about Atlantans?"

"The fish people? Ok, sure they can have freedom and equality too."

"What about druidicDryads?"

"Yes, the tree people can also have freedom."

"What about-"

"Stop naming various ethnicities already! Look, everyone will get freedom and equality."

It is very important for Mungs to be a sovereign nation. We don't want end up like the Zeppelinomads.

Nomads that roamed the air in the their floating cities. To be honest, they
were a nuisance. They would hunt birds for food, hijack airships, and dump
their trash on the people below. Luckily, the government wiped them all out by
igniting all of their hydrogen and taking away all of their precious helium.

druidicDryads show up to ask Fera to promise that she will protect the trees,
Atlantans ask Fera to promise to respect the oceans. Fera agrees in exchange
for their promise to support the revolution.

A descendant of the Zeppelinomads approaches Fera asking for her help to rebuild
the Zeppelin civilization. Fera's advisors tell her not to because Zeppelinomads
were jerks.

"Why is there a downvote arrow on your head?"

Fera asks what the Zeppelinomads what he can bring to the revolution.
He says that he can control the air.

"What good are gusts of wind good for?"

"Well if you have sails, I can fill them with air on windless day."

Fera waited for additional benefits, but then realized that the list ended with
the first item.

"Ok, so you will be useful when we are on some kind of vehicle propelled by
wind."

"Yes, the obvious example is a sailboat, but land yachts also have sails.
There's also parasailing, paragliding, and windsurfing."

Fera asks him for a demonstration, but the
exposure to sinistrae makes the demo very unimpressive.

"I think I felt something, but honestly I am not sure."

"That's what SHE said!" Eiva broke out laughing, then stopped laughing when she
saw that no one else was laughing.

"You don't have that joke here?"

"Obviously not, what's so funny?"

"Well, here is a guy who started off really confident, tried really hard to
impress us with skills until he was red in the face, and we barely felt a
thing, and I said that's what SHE said." Eiva broke out laughing again.

"It honestly is really funny. Y'all just don't understand." Eiva said a bit offended.

"Ok, I have seen enough. How many soldiers do you have?"

"Soldiers?"

"Yes, how many soldiers can you contribute to the revolution?"

"Zeppelinomads were always peaceful. We only stole what we needed for our
floating cities."

"Ok, if you do not have any soldiers, what do you have? Workers? Inventors?
Farmers?"

"We never farmed because we were nomads and lived in floating cities, but we
raised on our own birds. There were workers and inventors in Zeppelin
civilization, but now I am the only left."

"Wait, you're the only left?"

"Yes, as far as I know."

"And your only talent is moving air around?"

"Yes, but I am sure that with time and training I could master the other elements as well."

"Ok, I think we may have a use for you. Your job is stand next to me and fan
me. I don't want you speak, just fan me silently while looking at me with
complete admiration. I don't want to know your name. I will just call you
fanboy."

"Where should I get the fan?"

"Show a little initiative and find the fan yourself, you little runt! Do you
think the bone queen should solve all of your problems? Get going before I fill
you with hydrogen and light you on fire!" Fera exploded, finally losing her
patience.

Fera later becomes the CorporateCouncil Chair and becomes the most popular
streamer in the DemocracticDelegation. She is exhausted from constant work
meetings and never-ending demands from her followers for more content. She
shares videos of Eiva and her baby girl along with videos of Kaia and her baby
boy. Fera's followers speculate that Kaia, Eiva, and Fera are in a polyam
(polyamorous) relationship. Kaia does not use social media so only finds out
when she talks to Lita via her son. Lita is jealous. She thinks that Kaia got
rid of her so that she could live with Eiva and Fera.

"We are the druidicDryads, we speak for the trees!"

Fera stations guards around the secret locations of the eternalEnlighted. If
the eternalEnlighted ever disobey her, the guards are instructed to destroy all
of the brain tanks. She grants sovereignty to the Atlantans, druidicDryads,
Mungs, and Lunkers, as she promised, and she forms two new branches of
government: a monarchy with her as the queen and a council with a
representative from the Atlantans, the druidicDryads, the Lunkers, and the Mungs.

Fera gives herself a permanent seat on the new council with veto power and puts
her fanboy on the Council as the Zeppeliner representative and uses him as her
puppet.

Ryn asks for a seat on the council for mimics. Ben virtually represents scenders,
because he still cannot obtain a body. Kaia is asked to represent Martians.
Iona represents Thelusians.

Fera controls all branches of government. She is the matriarchalMonarch, the
permanent queen of the entire government, and Eiva's daughter will be Queen
after her. Kaia's son is referred to as the dark prince, he has no claim to the
throne, because only women can be matriarchalMonarchs. Kaia has to keep her
son's powers a secret. The other 4 branches of government advise her. She has
veto power and final say over their decisions. Fera is Chair of the
CorporateCouncil and the most popular streamer in the DemocracticDelegation.
She is a permanent member of the electedEthnicities representing sinistrae.
Dextrae do no get representation in the government.

Fera is planning to invade Mars and recover it from the Thelusians. Having
complete control of Earth, she launches her assault on Mars.

The next books focus on Eiva's daughter and Kaia's son. Eiva's daughter is
training to be queen. Kaia's son is not as good at controlling sinistrae as
Eiva's daughter. He is jealous of his older "sister". He has no claim to the
throne. He still has dreams of Mars. His mother's dreams bleed over into his
dreams. He wants to bring back his father, his other mother, his mother's
friend, but he cannot since dextrae technology has been banned. He has to keep
his ability to control dextrae a secret. He is planning to destroy the current
world and bring back dekstrae.

When Kaia and Lita are reunited.

Kaia was apprehensive. She could not help be remember the last time she stood
over a peoplePrinter waiting for Lita to be brought back to life. Her son
assured her that this time would be different. He was printing a body for Lita
that was many years older than the body she had before so Kaia and Lita could
be the same age, like before. Kaia was braced for heartbreak. When the lid to
the personPrinter opened, she was already in tears. Lita got out the
personPrinter, Kaia was amazed with amazing she looked. Kaia searched Lita's
face for signs of hatred or resentment. What she saw in Lita's face prompted
Kaia to throw her arms around Lita and hug her. Lita hugged her back. Her smell
was the same as before. Her touch was electrifying. Kaia did not allow herself
to believe just yet.

Kaia asks a question that only Lita can answer. When Lita answers it correctly,
Kaia gasps and reaches out to touch Lita's face. "It's really you." Lita nods.
They are both crying. Kaia starts to explain. "The years without you. Every
night I dreamt of you." Lita placed a hand on either side of Kaia's face and
gazed deeply into her eyes as they widened with shock. Lita crashed her face in
Kaia's, kissing her deep. Kaia melted into Lita's strong yet soft hands. The
room exploded with colors. Had they never kissed before? Kaia realized that she
had never really kissed anyone before. Kaia broke from the kiss. She was
hyperventilating and her head was spinning. She held onto Lita, who looked at
her with an amused expression on her face.

"Was it that good? I wasn't expecting you get all googly eyed on me."

Kaia started to laugh. Lita was back after years living as in the scenderverse.
Her worries that things would be different were dispelled. The horrible
waiting, the terrible uncertainty, the crushing doubt, all of it faded away.
Kaia couldn't express what she was feeling.

"We should probably get going. We have a planet to reconquer." Kaia's son said,
uncomfortable with the intense display of affection.

Kaia had forgotten she was not alone with Lita. Kaia became annoyed and was no
longer willing to hide her emotions.

"I've waited years for this. I never asked any of you for anything, never
anything for myself. Get the hell out and leave us alone!"

Kaia's son was shocked.

"Sure, no problem. You're welcome for reuniting you with the love of your life
by the way. Now that I've accomplished the impossible, I'll just go and sit in
a dark room by myself."

Kaia pulled Lita by the hand towards the table, thinking they could chat and
catch up after years of separation. Lita pulled Kaia in, wrapping her arms
around her lower back and burying her head in Kaia's chest.

"These are bigger than I remember."

Kaia struggled to catch her breath. Her heart was pounding. She felt like she
had been running for hours. Lita grabbed Kaia's hands and rested them on her
shoulders. Then grabbing the backs of Kaia's thighs, Lita lifted Kaia up with
ease and gently sat her down on the table.

"Were did you learn these moves?"

"I've been planning this for years and I watched a lot of naughty videos while
I was waiting for you to make me a new body."

Kaia laughed. "Are you planning to do something naughty to me?"

"I honestly wouldn't even know where to begin.", Lita admitted, "I was a virgin
before I died and I didn't even have a body in the scenderverse, much less a love life."

"I'm still a virgin too.", Kaia said bashfully.

"Shut up! How can you be a virgin when you have a kid?", Lita said, putting her hands on her hips.

"No, it's true! Zek did-"

"I remember. You told me before. I was just teasing you."


No one can carry a cellphone because during the war cellphone's could be caused
to detonate spontaneously. Kaia later learns to detonate anything with a fuel
cell, e.g. powerskates, powergloves, energy weapons, airships, etc. Kaia has a
dream that she is the mummy queen crawling through the airship. She finds the
airship fuel cells and destroys them. When Kaia wakes up the fuel cells have
actually been destroyed. The airship crashes into Zakrz√≥wek quarry lake.

Bring in a Relic character to be a romantic partner for Dela. The silos are
all connected. The AI explains that there is a survivor from the war between
sinistrae and dekstrae intact in stasis. The AI explains that Eiva is pregnant
and she was selected to be the first person to be awakened as part of the plan
to bring about the resurgence of sinistrae. The AI tells Fera that she should
awaken Eiva and start introducing her to the new world and meanwhile Eiva will
teach Fera how to use sinistrae powers. When Eiva awakens she admits that Eiva
was not originally her name, but the AI said that she would pick a new name for
her that matched the time when she was awakened. Eiva's husband died trying to
protect the silos and keep them hidden. The AI does not try to create a full
name for Eiva and instead suggests that she add Fera's mother's name and Fera's
maternal grandmother's name (Eivavikadela Fridzia) and pretend she is Fera's sister.

Eiva and Fera develop a relationship and start sleeping together.

"After being frozen for thousands of years, I thought you might be a bit... frigid."

Eiva tackled Fera and started to throttle her.

"Oh, how did you know that's what I'm into?", Dela said, laughing.

Ryn discovers them. "You are together with Eiva?!" Then, a mischievous look
overtook Ryn's face. "Remember when you accused me of sleeping with my sister?
Turns out that you're an incestuous hypocrite."

Eiva looked puzzled.

"You're going to pay for that, you filthy moleman!"

Fera thinks that Eiva was lying to her about being pregnant. Eiva says she did
not know she was pregnant. She did not know it was possible for an embryo to
survive stasis. "When the baby is born, will our relationship change?", Fera
asked nervously.

Eiva's baby is a girl. Kaia's baby is a boy.

Lost civilizations:
- Mimics: Government/Corporate scientists did not decode all of the information they received via intergalactic broadcasts. The information on Mimic culture and philosophy were not deemed important enough to spend time decoding. The fragments that the Mimics were able to piece together became the basis of Mimic culture on Earth. The Mimics want to find the remaining information to learn the purpose of their existence and the story behind the intergalactic broadcasts that carried the recipe for their creation.
- Martians: Martian civilization ended in a war with Thelusians, a space dwelling civilization that replaced most people with androids. The space settlements started to orbit Mars and eventually all crashed into the surface of Mars. The remnants of Martian civilization and the Thelusian civilization are both still on the surface of Mars. Corporations from Earth have to fight with Thelusians for territory to mine resources from Mars. Martians are thought to have died out.
- Thelusians:
- Sinistrae:

Book 2:
The Mummy Queen eventually corrupts Kaia's son. He recognizes her as his mother.
On Mars, Kaia goes insane and becomes a second Mummy Queen. Together they repel the sinistrae invasion (home court advantage) and create an new army of sinistrae and dextrae Thelusians. Zek and Zok see this is a realization of their plan. Ursa wants to stay with her son. Iona joins them as she sees it as a chance for the Thelusian civilization to regain its dominance of space. Mars and Earth prepare for interplanetary war. Without Kaia and her son, the sinistrae are no match for dextrae firepower and have to retreat. The Mummy Queens plan to spread their power to Earth and since the sinistrae do not have the firepower to stop them, they launch an invasion immediately. Eiva's daughter tries to convince Kaia's son to broker peace, but he says that they will have peace Earth is conquered. He says that he wants to rule both planets with Eiva's daughter at his side as his queen. Sata tries to convince Kaia to come back to her, but Kaia is consumed to the point that Sata cannot tell which of the two Mummy Queens are her Kaia. The invasion is a success. As part of the surrender agreement, Eiva's daughter marries Kaia's son and they will rule both planets as the bone princess and the shadow prince. The Thelusian civilization is rebuilt with Iona as its Queen. The Thelusians enslave the Mungs and space prisoners. Zek and Zok marry the Mummy Queens and become the Mummy Kings. Eiva's daughter is pregnant. Kaia's son is happy to have an heir to the throne, even though he believes that his reign will be eternal. Sata, Fera, and Eiva are confined in the bone palace (a palace built from the bones of Fera's enemies) and help take care of the baby. Ryn plans to destroy both sinistrae and dextrae, though he is unsure if it will be possible to change anything now that the villains have complete control of both Mars and Earth. The book ends with Ryn contacting a nearby mimic civilization that was built from s from sinistrae and dextrae particles that started to react to signals sent by distant mimic civilizations. The particles self-construct into a non-organic mimic civilization. The mimics reveal that they are intergalactic conquerors and that purpose of the messages were to have mimics infiltrate planets and conquer planets them from within or to soften their defense before the eventual invasion. The mimic civilization asks if the people of Earth and Mars were kind to him and other mimics. Ryn replies that they were not. The mimic civilization instructs Ryn to wait for the invasion. As mimics do not age, Ryn will still be alive when the invasion arrives. Ryn decides not to warn anyone about the invasion. Ryn doesn't want to wait for the invasion, so he enters a stasis pod like the one Eiva used. As Ryn enters the pod, he thinks about everyone and wonders if they will still be alive when he wakes up.

Book 3:
The third book starts with a surprise attack by the invading mimic forces. Earth, Mars, and the Thelusians are brought to their knees. The mimics begin to take control. Characters previously oppressed by the rulers of Earth and Mars are now forced to fight the mimics in addition to fighting to survive. New ethnicities have formed since the ending of the 2nd book. Ryn awakes and welcomes the invading forces, but they reject him because he is a weakling. The messages were only partially decoded by Earth's scientists and the invading mimics see Ryn as a flaw. Ryn decides to fight back against the mimic invasion. He hides the fact that he knew about the invasion from the other members of the resistance. The new mimics keep humans and old mimics alive to study how they have adapted to life on Earth. It turns out the old mimics adapted to be symbiotic humans while the new mimics are parasitic. New mimics can impregnate human men and women. Human men typically die after giving birth to a mimic baby, while human women typically survive the birth. Old mimics can only become pregnant themselves after interacting with humans. As the invading mimics adapt, it becomes difficult to say who is human, new mimic, and old mimic. Part of humanity escapes into space away from the mimic invaders. The new mimics rule over and oppress the humans and the old mimics. The humans and old mimics form an alliance against the new mimic oppressors. A new hero arises who gains the ability to fight back after she masters an ancient AI (the UNO AI is brought under control when the hero says tries to use a defective sudoku puzzle to destroy the AI, "command ku not found", "I guessed wrong", "Welcome guest wrong"). She is able to understand the thoughts of new mimics, old mimics, and humans. She teaches humans about the mimic hivemind. She uses her powers to destroy the new mimic power structure, killing off most of the people. The AI informs her that she made a mistake and the setback to technological progress could be disastrous. If the infighting and the setbacks to technological progress continue then humanity and mimicity will be unprepared for when Earth will be consumed by the Sun. The hero tries to organize the survivors, humans, new mimics, and old mimics alike, to work together to prepare for the Sun's expansion. The hero decides that the only way to ensure stability is install herself as the new ruler of Earth and Mars. The AI agrees and helps the hero to take over. The hero starts crushing those who defied her and rules over Mars and Earth with a iron fist calling herself the All Queen. She begins to transmit signals similar to those coming from the distant mimic civilizations, intending to destroy nascent mimic civilizations, and create more of her own civilizations throughout the universe. She makes plans to move first Earth and then Mars to escape the Sun's expansion. The All Queen sends out colony ships in all directions planning to conquer nearby worlds when Andromeda collides with the Milky Way and rule over all of Milkomeda.
