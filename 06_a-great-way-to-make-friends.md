## Chapter 6: A great way to make friends

Dela, Ryn, and Naksos arrive at the refugee camp. Pert is reunited with his
father. Ryn is reunited with Aira and Lans. Dela tells Kaia and Lita that she
has changed and is deeply sorry for how she behaved earlier.

Dela arm wrestles Figa, Ursa, and Ed, beating all of them.

"Laughing in people's faces after you win is a great way to make friends."

The chapter ends with a celebration in the refugee camp honoring the return of
Dela, Ryn, and Naksos.
