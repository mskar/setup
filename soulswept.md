# Soulswept

Kaia would have given anything to be normal. Filled with dread and paralyzed by
anxiety, she wished she could be carefree and unconcerned like the other
students in the cacophonous gymnasium.

There was no way out. The polyethylene bleachers where Kaia sat were packed
with the entire cohort of high school freshman. All around the bleachers,
robotic animals buzzed, growled, and roared, while observing the
students.

Kaia leaned in to her best friend Lita and whispered in her ear.

"Let's run."

"We wouldn't even make it to the door, which is locked by the way."

"If we run, they'll have to knock us out and we'll miss the ceremony."

Kaia and Lita looked at the hexagonal holes in the walls where the robotic
insects made their nests. Inside the walls, there was a network of tunnels
filled with robotic insects constantly ready to swarm anyone who stepped out of
line.

"If the BuzzBees knocked us out, the WakeupWasps would sting us until we were
awake."

"Maybe if we act crazy, they'd knock us out to keep us from disrupting the
ceremony."

"Acting crazy should be easy for you, because you've always been insane."

Lita knew that the joke didn't land well, so she tried to reassure her friend.

"Maybe it won't be so bad. Maybe I won't have a seizure and you won't freak
out."

"Awww, you always know exactly what to say to keep me from freaking out."

Lita smiled and put her arm around Kaia pretending to put her into a headlock.
Before she realized it, Kaia's head was resting on Lita's shoulder as the two
embraced. Several students in their vicinity started to jeer.

"Get a room, you two!"

"The sexual tension is so taut you could cut it with a knife!"

"Which one is butch? Which one is femme?"

Kaia wondered if she was imagining the jeers until she felt Lita tense up and
eventually withdraw from their embrace. For as long as she could remember, Kaia
had auditory hallucinations. She always had trouble differentiating between the
voices of people around her and the voices in her head.

To make matters worse, Kaia often had strange dreams at night and weird visions
during the day. The dreams and visions seemed so real and familiar that it
sometimes took Kaia a long time to reacclimatize to reality.

The jeering continued until the school principal walked up to the podium in
front of the bleachers. Suddenly the gymnasium fell quiet. Even the robotic
animals were silent as the principal cleared his throat and
prepared to speak.

Already sweating, the principal his brow with a lace handkerchief he retrieved
the pocket of his blazer. With three clicks of his tongue, the principal
summoned three robotic bees. The bees landed on the principal's face and neck
and used their stingers to administer the pharmacological relief that the
principal would need to collect his frayed nerves.

"Today we welcome a new cohort of-"

As the principal began to speak, a student with bright purple hair jumped on
top of her seat in the bleachers and began to shout into a hand-held sound
amplification device.

"Corporeal punishment is barbaric and ineffective!"

"TaserTutors are torture!"

"Reform the school system!"

A robotic primate jumped down from the rafters and tackled the student,
knocking the sound amplifier out of her hand. Several more robotic primates
scooped up the student and dragged her out of the gymnasium.

Visibly shaken, the principal repeated his pre-speech ceremony by clearing his
throat again and clicking his tongue three more times. The three additional
robotic bee stings were successful in calming down the principal, but when the
principal resumed his speech, he was swaying side to side, gripping the podium
for support, and having difficulty speaking clearly.

"Dishipline and rispet for aufority are eshenshial for a funshioning shosh-"

The principal suddenly lurched forward and vomited all over the podium.

Wiping his mouth with the sleeve of his blazer, the principal wrapped up his
speech.

"Let the sheremony begin!"

As soon as an automated voice started calling students to participate in the
ceremony, the gymnasium erupted with the excited chatter of the students and
the sounds of the robotic wildlife.

Kaia leaned in to whisper to Lita again, but stopped when she noticed that her
friend was having a seizure. Lita's expressionless face moved ever so slightly
as she blankly stared into the distance.

When she realized that the seizure was relatively mild and that Lita would
recover shortly, Kaia let out a sigh of relief. While waiting for her friend to
recover, Kaia held Lita's hands, which unfortunately attracted the attention of
nearby students.

"I think she's about to propose!"

"Is that even legal?"

"Someone get the SecuritySimians to tackle those two!"

After seeing it countless times, Kaia knew exactly what to expect. As the
seizure ended, Lita looked around disoriented and confused. The part that
always broke Kaia's heart was when Lita looked embarrassed about having a
seizure. Lita pulled her hands away.

Never knowing what to say, Kaia tried to start a conversation.

"What do you think will happen to the protester?"

"She's going to get kicked out of school."

"How do you know?"

"She didn't go through the ceremony."

"Maybe we can protest too?"

Clearly not in the mood to continue the conversation, Lita did not reply.
The two friends sat in silence until Kaia's name was called.

Desperate for a means of escape, Kaia looked pleadingly at Lita. Trying her
best to be reassuring, Lita smiled weakly and gave Kaia a gesture of
encouragement. Left with no other option, Kaia got up and started to squeeze
through the rows of students.

Kaia could feel the eyes of the students and robotic wildlife follow her to the
metallic table next to the podium in front of the bleachers. As she approached,
the table began to writhe as it adjusted to match her height and build. Robotic
birds, bats, and bugs flew in circles above Kaia, recording her every move. A
wall of robotic hummingbirds hovered in front of her face, staring at her with
their piercing eyes.

When Kaia placed her palms down on the table, metallic tendrils extended from
the table and wrapped around her arms up to the shoulders. The automated voice
that had called Kaia's name earlier began to deliver commands.

"State your full name? You have 5 seconds to respond."

"Kaialeiala Arkadia."

"State your age in years. You have 5 seconds to respond."

"14."

"List the three branches of Government. You have 15 seconds to respond."

"The CorporateCouncil, the DemocraticDelegation, and the EternalEnlightened."

So far so good, but the next questions would be much more difficult.

"Given an average distance of 382 megameters, calculate the time in seconds required for a radio transmission to go from the surface of Earth to its moon and back? You have one minute to respond."

Kaia typed out the problem in the virtual keyboard on the table.
Distance: 382 megameters.
Speed of light: 300 megameters per second.
Time: 382 / 300 seconds = 1.27 seconds

Kaia opened her mouth to answer, but froze in horror.
"And back!", she said to herself.
"From Earth to the moon AND BACK!"

Terrified at the thought that she almost answered incorrectly, Kaia did the
final calculation in her head.

"2.54 seconds!"

Kaia braced for an electric shock, but was relieved to hear the next question
instead.

"Given a distance range of 590 to 980 gigameters, calculate the minimum time in
minutes required for a radio transmission to go from the surface of Earth to
Jupiter. You have one minute to respond."

Kaia's head was spinning.

"No 'and back' this time.", she said to herself.

"Minimum means 590 gigameters."

Distance: 590 gigameters
Speed of light: 18 gigameters per minute
Time: 590 / 18 seconds ...

"32.78 minutes."

The pressure was getting to Kaia. She loved math, but hated solving word
problems under threat of electric shock while everyone was watching. Luckily,
the next question tested general knowledge.

"Which mineral group is the most abundant in Earth's crust and what are it's
three endmembers? You have 30 seconds to respond."

"The feldspars are the most abundant. The endmembers are potassium feldspar,
albite, and anorthite."

"Construct the basic subunit of the feldspar chemical structure. You have three
minutes to respond."

The display on the table transformed from a keyboard into the periodic chart of
elements. On top of each square on the chart was a sphere that represented an
element. Kaia used the display to enter the number of atoms of each she would
need. Each time she entered a number, a new set of spheres appeared in front of
her. In total, Kaia had 4 potassium atoms, 4 aluminum atoms, 12 silicon atoms,
and 128 oxygen atoms. Kaia began arranging the spheres. The metallic tendrils
extending from the table stretched as she moved her hands from sphere to
sphere. First, Kaia created 16 tiny pyramids by sticking 4 oxygen atoms to each
aluminum and silicon atom. Then, she combined the pyramids into 4 rings by
removing an oxygen from each pyramid and replacing it with the oxygen of
another pyramid. Next, Kaia removed an oxygen to from each ring to arrange the
rings in pairs. After removing an oxygen from each pair, Kaia stacked the pairs
on top of each other. Finally, Kaia put two potassium atoms in the middle of
the structure and then the last two potassium atoms on opposites corners of the
structure.

"This is the chemical structure of the basic subunit of potassium feldspar."

Kaia's arms felt like they were made of feldspar. She was so exhausted that she
almost did not care if she answered correctly or not.

"Describe the mineral composition of the Martian crust. You have 30 seconds to
respond."

"The crust of Mars includes volcanic rock minerals such as feldspars,
pyroxenes, and olivine."

"Explain the origin of nanostructures on the surface of Mars. You have 30
seconds to respond."

"The nanostructures originate from the two sources: the ancient Martian civilization-"

Kaia stopped mid-sentence. She felt like her mouth was filled with Martian
dust. A pulsing red light warned Kaia that pauses were not allowed.

"-and Thelusian spacecrafts that collided with Mars during the Martian-Thelusian War."

Kaia looked up. The sky, once dark with orbiting spacecrafts, lit up as the
entire Thelusian armada began to enter the thin Martian atmosphere.

"Compare and contrast the EternalEnlightened with the other branches of
government. You have 30 seconds to respond."

People all around Kaia began to run for cover, but she knew there was nowhere
to hide. Everyone was running and screaming except for her and Lita.

"What is Lita doing here on Mars?", Kaia wondered.

With an alarmed and desperate look on her face, Lita pointed down in front of
Kaia. Unsure why Lita was pointing down and not up at impending cataclysm in
the sky, Kaia looked down at the pulsing red light emanating from the metallic
table. Kaia's body shook with electricity. Time had run out. Mars was doomed.

"Given that the Venusian orbital period is 225 days, calculate how many days
would pass before Earth and Venus would return to their current positions. You
have 30 seconds to respond."

Kaia was having trouble maintain her footing. Beneath her feet, countless
skeletons were crumbling into dust. The dust began to swirl in circles around
Kaia, as a ferocious wind built up into a raging storm. In the eye of the
storm, Kaia stood staring at the remnants of an extinguished world. When
lightning shot out of storm and struck Kaia, she screamed, not in pain, but in
anger.

With the loss of an entire civilization weighing down on her, Kaia fell to her
knees. The storm eventually began to subside and through the dust and skeletal
fragments Kaia could see the pulsing red light of the metallic table.
The tendrils were still wrapped around her arms. The ceremony was still
ongoing.

Another shock from the tendrils caused Kaia to spasm and she hit her head on
the table. Enraged, Kaia stood up to look at the console atop the table. There
was no way to stop the ceremony once it had begun and breaking free from the
tendrils was impossible. The automated voice continued providing instructions,
but Kaia was no longer paying attention. The ceremony seemed so insignificant
when compared to the destruction of Mars. As the table, once again begun to
pulse red, Kaia used the virtual keyboard to skip the current task.

The resulting electric shock only added to the rage that Kaia felt. Kaia
skipped each task again and again as soon as she could control her fingers
after each subsequent electric shock. Kaia kept trying to skip even after the
console stopped responding and the tendrils began to unwrap from around her
arms. Tears were streaming down her face. Her ears were ringing. The burning
smell was suffocating. Her breathing was hoarse and uneven. Her mouth tasted
like it was coated with metal.

Bracing against the table for support, Kaia was an easy target for the robotic
primates. As she was dragged out of the gymnasium, Kaia looked towards the
bleachers searching for Lita in the sea of students, who were all standing and
staring.

Kaia is brought to Principal's office. Mora is there, bruised and battered,
being held by a GuardGorilla. A GuardGorilla puts Kaia in the seat next to
Mora. The principal is passed out in his chair with drool coming from open
mouth. Kaia and Mora talk before the Principal wakes up. The Principal asks
Kaia if mental illness caused her to fail the ceremony or skipping the tasks a
protest like the one Mora did.

TODO:
- name types of SecuritySimians (robotic primates): GuardGorillas, ObservationOrangutans, etc
- describe the gigaphone Mora had: Gigaphones, sound amplifications devices capable of producing
sounds 3 decibels louder than a megaphone, were so loud as to be classified as
weapons.

...


fit in at school. Thinking about her friendship with Lita, Kaia wondered if the
only reason that they were friends was because they were both abnormal.

Lita did not suffer from mental illness like Kaia. Instead, Lita had a
neurological condition called epilepsy.

Lita often had absentee seizures that would incapacitate her for short periods
of time and leave her feeling weak and disoriented. The more severe seizures,
during which Lita appeared to be tormented by invisible demons and tossed about
by an unseen hand, were mercifully rare.

None of the other students seemed to be at all concerned with the secondary
school initiation ceremony.

covered their ears. loud audio system in the gymnasium had no chance sound of
the gigaphone, 3 decibels louder , was deafening.

Seeing her best which Lita appeared to be tormented by invisible demons and
tossed about by an unseen hand, were mercifully rare. Kaia held Lita's hands,
which unfortunately led to another round of jeers. Seeing her best which Lita
appeared to be tormented by invisible demons and tossed about by an unseen
hand, were mercifully rare.
