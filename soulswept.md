When she was satisfied, Dela helped the Principal out of his
chair and out the door of his office. The Principal was almost instantly
out-of-breath, but impending death can be a powerful motivator and he kept
moving towards the exit. Every other step that Dela took was followed by a
squishing noise as the vomit in her shoe moved flowed back and forth.

fit in at school. Thinking about her friendship with Lita,
Kaia wondered if the only reason that they were friends was because they were
both abnormal.

Lita did not suffer from mental illness like Kaia. Instead, Lita had a
neurological condition called epilepsy.

Lita often had absentee seizures that would incapacitate her for short periods
of time and leave her feeling weak and disoriented. The more severe seizures,
during which Lita appeared to be tormented by invisible demons and tossed about
by an unseen hand, were mercifully rare.

None of the other students seemed to be at all concerned with the secondary
school initiation ceremony.

the gigaphone, 3 decibels louder , was deafening.

Seeing her best which Lita appeared to be tormented by invisible demons and

which unfortunately led to another round of jeers. Seeing her best which Lita

"Can I tell you something? I want to tell you, but you mustn't tell anyone
anything, please."

Kaia emphatically agreed and Lita was quick to echo the sentiment.

"When I was little, I lived in a orphanage made of stone. I was happy, because
I had so many friends, but it was hard. There was no one to take care of us.
Everyone was hungry all of the time, except for me, because-", Lan looked
around the empty airship cabin, "I can photosynthesize."

"After all the buildings were replaced with factories, we stopped seeing any
grown-ups anymore, everything was automated or controlled remotely. The river
slowly turned into sludge and all the vegetation died. My friends and I stopped
being able to find food. I didn't want to see them starve, so I begged them to
eat me first, but they wouldn't, they said they didn't want to hurt me. When it
got really bad, I was the only who could still move. I would cut off pieces",
Lan pointed to his torso, arms, and legs, "and give it to them, but the meat
would grow back so slowly and there were so many friends to feed. When a friend
died, I would redistribute them to the friends who were still alive, but soon
all my friends were gone. When the constructions crews came to clear the
orphanage, they saw me escaping from the rubble. They thought that I ate my
friends to survive. I couldn't tell them the truth. People who are different
get taken. My parents were taken, because they were different. If someone finds
out about me, I will get taken too. That's why you mustn't tell anyone
anything."

When Lan finished his story, Kaia looked back at Lita. Neither of them had any
idea what to do.

"Everyone has these incredibly traumatic events in their lives. Are you going
to surprise me with some trauma I never heard about even though we grew up 
together?"

"No, are you?"
"No, before today I really didn't have much going on in the trauma department."
"I think you are projecting the Lunkers who saved you onto Officer Kransal."
"Yes, I think you are right but it still makes me happy, so I think it is ok."
