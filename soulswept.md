# Soulswept

Kaia would have given anything to be normal. Filled with dread and paralyzed by
anxiety, she wished she could be carefree and unconcerned like the other
students in the cacophonous gymnasium.

There was no way out. The polyethylene bleachers where Kaia sat were packed
with the entire cohort of high school freshman. All around the bleachers,
robotic animals and insects buzzed, growled, sang, and hooted while observing
the students.

Kaia leaned in to her best friend Lita and whispered in her ear.

"Let's run."

"We wouldn't even make it to the door, which is locked by the way."

"If we run, they'll have to knock us out and we'll miss the ceremony."

Kaia and Lita looked at the hexagonal holes in the walls where the robotic
insects made their nests. Inside the walls, there was a network of tunnels
filled with robotic insects constantly ready to swarm anyone who stepped out of
line.

"If the BuzzBees knocked us out, the WakeupWasps would sting us until we were
awake."

"Maybe if we act crazy, they'd wouldn't wake us to keep us from disrupting the
ceremony."

"Acting crazy should be easy for you, because you've always been insane."

Lita knew that the joke didn't land well, so she tried to reassure her friend.

"Maybe it won't be so bad. Maybe I won't have a seizure and you won't freak
out."

"Awww, you always know exactly what to say to keep me from freaking out."

Lita smiled and put her arm around Kaia pretending to put her into a headlock.
Before she realized it, Kaia's head was resting on Lita's shoulder as the two
embraced. Several students in their vicinity started to jeer.

"Get a room, you two!"

"The sexual tension is so taut you could cut it with a knife!"

"Which one is butch? Which one is femme?"

Kaia wondered if she was imagining the jeers until she felt Lita tense up and
eventually withdraw from their embrace. For as long as she could remember, Kaia
had auditory hallucinations. She always had trouble differentiating between the
voices of people around her and the voices in her head.

To make matters worse, Kaia often had strange dreams at night and weird visions
during the day. The dreams and visions seemed so real and familiar that it
sometimes took Kaia a long time to reacclimatize to reality.

The jeering continued until the school principal walked up to the podium in
front of the bleachers. Suddenly the gymnasium fell quiet. Even the robotic
animals and insects were silent as the principal cleared his throat and
prepared to speak.

Already sweating, the principal wiped sweat from his brow with a lace
handkerchief he retrieved the pocket of his blazer. With three clicks of his
tongue, the principal summoned three robotic bees. The bees landed on the
principal's face and neck and used their stingers to administer the
pharmacological relief that the principal would need to collect his frayed
nerves.

"Today we welcome a new cohort of-"

As the principal began to speak, one of the students jumped on top of her seat
in the bleachers and began to shout into a hand-held sound amplification
device.

"Corporeal punishment is unjust!"

"Abolish TaserTutors!"

"Reform the penal system!"

"End forced labor!"

A robotic primate jumped down from the rafters and tackled the student, knocking
the sound amplifier out of her hand. Several more robotic primates scooped up the
student and dragged her out of the gymnasium.

Visibly shaken, the principal repeated his pre-speech ceremony by clearing his
throat again and clicking his tongue three more times. The three additional
robotic bee stings were successful in calming down the principal, but when the
principal resumed his speech, he was swaying side to side, gripping the podium
for support, and having difficulty speaking clearly.

"Dishipline and rispet for aufority are eshenshial for a funshioning-"

The principal suddenly lurched forward and vomited all over the podium.

Wiping his mouth with the sleeve of his blazer, the principal wrapped up his speech.

"Let the sheremony begin!"

As the automated voice started calling students up to the testing chamber, the
gymnasium erupted with the excited chatter of the students and the sounds of
the robotic wildlife.

Kaia leaned in to whisper to Lita again, but stopped when she noticed that her
friend was having a seizure. Lita's expressionless face was frozen as she
blankly stared into the distance.

When she realized that the seizure was relatively mild and that Lita would
recover shortly, Kaia let out a sigh of relief. The few times Kaia had seen her
friend experience a severe seizure had left a indelible mark in Kaia's memory.

Kaia's

"I think she's about to propose!"

"Is that even legal?"

"Someone get the SecuritySimians to tackle those two!"

thought about how they never fit in at school. Thinking
about her friendship with Lita, Kaia wondered if the only reason that they were
friends was because they were both abnormal.

Lita did not suffer from mental illness like Kaia. Instead, Lita had a
neurological condition called epilepsy.

Lita often had absentee seizures that would incapacitate her for short periods
of time and leave her feeling weak and disoriented. The more severe seizures,
during which Lita appeared to be tormented by invisible demons and tossed about
by an unseen hand, were mercifully rare.

None of the other students seemed to be at all concerned with the secondary
school initiation ceremony.

Kaia could hear  Gigaphones, sound amplifications
devices capable of producing sounds 3 decibels louder than a megaphone, were so
loud as to be classified as weapons.

covered their ears. loud audio system in
the gymnasium had no chance sound of the gigaphone, 3 decibels louder , was
deafening.

Seeing her best which Lita appeared to be
tormented by invisible demons and tossed about by an unseen hand, were
mercifully rare. Kaia held Lita's hands, which unfortunately led to another
round of jeers.
