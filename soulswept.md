# Soulswept

## Chapter 1

Keia would have given anything to be normal. Filled with dread and paralyzed by
anxiety, she wished she could be carefree and unconcerned like the other
students in the cacophonous gymnasium.

There was no way out. The polyethylene bleachers where Keia sat were packed
with the entire cohort of high school freshman. All around the bleachers,
robotic animals buzzed, growled, and roared, while observing the
students.

Keia leaned in to her best friend Lita and whispered in her ear.

"Let's run."

"We wouldn't even make it to the door, which is locked by the way."

"If we run, they'll have to knock us out and we'll miss the ceremony."

Keia and Lita looked at the hexagonal holes in the walls. Inside the walls,
there was a network of tunnels filled with robotic insects always ready to
swarm anyone who stepped out of line.

"If the buzzBees knocked us out, the wakeupWasps would sting us until we were
awake."

"Maybe if we act crazy, they'd knock us out to keep us from disrupting the
ceremony."

"Acting crazy should be easy for you, because you've always been insane."

Lita could see that the joke didn't land well, so she tried to reassure her
friend.

"Maybe it won't be so bad. Maybe I won't have a seizure and you won't freak
out."

"Awww, you always know exactly what to say to keep me from freaking out."

Lita smiled and put her arm around Keia pretending to put her into a headlock.
Before she realized it, Keia's head was resting on Lita's shoulder as the two
embraced. Several students in their vicinity started to jeer.

"Get a room, you two!"

"Looks like the sexual tension was too much for them!"

"Which one is butch? And what do you call the other one?"

Keia wondered if she was imagining the jeers until she felt Lita tense up and
eventually withdraw from their embrace. For as long as she could remember, Keia
had auditory hallucinations. She always had trouble differentiating between the
voices of people around her and the voices in her head.

To make matters worse, Keia often had strange dreams at night and weird visions
during the day. The dreams and visions seemed so real and familiar that it
sometimes took Keia a long time to reacclimatize to reality.

The jeering continued until the school principal walked up to the podium in
front of the bleachers. Suddenly the gymnasium fell quiet. Even the robotic
animals were silent as the principal cleared his throat and
prepared to speak.

Already sweating, the principal his brow with a lace handkerchief he retrieved
the pocket of his blazer. With three clicks of his tongue, the principal
summoned three robotic bees. The buzzBees landed on the principal's face and
neck and used their stingers to administer the pharmacological relief that the
principal would need to collect his frayed nerves.

"Today we welcome a new cohort of-"

As the principal began to speak, a student with bright purple hair jumped on
top of her seat in the bleachers and began to shout into a hand-held gigaphone.

"Corporeal punishment is barbaric and ineffective!"

"taserTutors are torture!"

"Reform the school system!"

A chaseChimpanzee jumped down from the rafters and tackled the student,
knocking the gigaphone out of her hand. Several guardGorillas
scooped up the student and carried her out of the gymnasium.

Visibly shaken, the principal repeated his pre-speech ritual by clearing his
throat again and clicking his tongue three more times. The three additional
robotic bee stings were successful in calming down the principal, but when the
principal resumed his speech, he was swaying side to side, gripping the podium
for support, and having difficulty speaking clearly.

"Dishipline and rispet for aufority are eshenshial for a funshioning shosh-"

The principal suddenly lurched forward and vomited all over the podium.

Wiping his mouth with the sleeve of his blazer, the principal wrapped up his
speech.

"Let the sheremony begin!"

As soon as an automated voice started calling students to participate in the
initiation ceremony, the gymnasium erupted with the excited chatter of the
students and the sounds of the robotic wildlife.

Keia leaned in to whisper to Lita again, but stopped when she noticed that her
friend was having a seizure. Lita's expressionless face moved ever so slightly
as she blankly stared into the distance.

When she realized that the seizure was relatively mild and that Lita would
recover shortly, Keia let out a sigh of relief. While waiting for her friend to
recover, Keia held Lita's hands, which unfortunately attracted the attention of
nearby students.

"I think she's about to propose!"

"Is that even legal?"

"Someone get the securitySimians to arrest those two!"

After seeing it countless times, Keia knew exactly what to expect. As the
seizure ended, Lita looked around disoriented and confused. The part that
always broke Keia's heart was when Lita looked embarrassed about having a
seizure. Lita pulled her hands away.

Never knowing what to say, Keia tried to start a conversation.

"What do you think will happen to the protester?"

"She's going to get kicked out of school."

"How do you know?"

"She didn't go through the ceremony."

"Maybe we can protest too?"

Clearly not in the mood to continue the conversation, Lita did not reply.
The two friends sat in silence until Keia's name was called.

Desperate for a means of escape, Keia looked pleadingly at Lita. Trying her
best to be reassuring, Lita smiled weakly and gave Keia a gesture of
encouragement. Left with no other option, Keia got up and started to squeeze
through the rows of students.

Keia could feel the eyes of the students and robotic animals follow her to the
taserTutor next to the podium in front of the bleachers. The taserTutor looked
a table covered with a silvery hair. As she approached, the taserTutor began to
writhe as it adjusted to match her height and build. Robotic birds, bats, and
bugs flew in circles above Keia. A wall of historianHummingbirds hovered in
front of her face, recording her every move from multiple angles , staring at
her with their piercing eyes, relaying everything they saw to the projector
system that displayed a multitude of video feeds on the hexagonal walls of the
gymnasium.

When Keia placed her palms down on the taserTutor, metallic tendrils extended from
the taserTutor and wrapped around her arms up to the shoulders like vines around a
tree. The automated voice that had called Keia's name earlier began to deliver
commands.

"State your full name? You have 5 seconds to respond."

"Keialeiala Arkadia."

"State your age in years. You have 5 seconds to respond."

"14."

"List the three branches of Government. You have 15 seconds to respond."

"The CorporateCouncil, the DemocraticDelegation, and the EternalEnlightened."

So far so good, but the next questions would be much more difficult.

"Given an average distance of 382 megameters, calculate the time in seconds
required for a radio transmission to go from the surface of Earth to its moon
and back? You have one minute to respond."

Keia typed out the problem in the virtual keyboard on the taserTutor.
Distance: 382 megameters.
Speed of light: 300 megameters per second.
Time: 382 / 300 seconds = 1.27 seconds

Keia opened her mouth to answer, but froze in horror.
"And back!", she said to herself.
"From Earth to the moon AND BACK!"

Terrified at the thought that she almost answered incorrectly, Keia did the
final calculation in her head.

"2.54 seconds!"

Keia braced for an electric shock, but was relieved to hear the next question
instead.

"Given a distance range of 590 to 980 gigameters, calculate the minimum time in
minutes required for a radio transmission to go from the surface of Earth to
Jupiter. You have one minute to respond."

Keia's head was spinning.

"No 'and back' this time.", she said to herself. "Minimum means 590
gigameters."

Distance: 590 gigameters
Speed of light: 18 gigameters per minute
Time: 590 / 18 seconds ...

"32.78 minutes."

The pressure was getting to Keia. She loved math, but hated solving word
problems under threat of electric shock while everyone was watching. Luckily,
the next question tested general knowledge.

"Which mineral group is the most abundant in Earth's crust and what are it's
three endmembers? You have 30 seconds to respond."

"The feldspars are the most abundant. The endmembers are potassium feldspar,
albite, and anorthite."

"Construct the basic subunit of the feldspar chemical structure. You have three
minutes to respond."

The display on the taserTutor transformed from a keyboard into the periodic
chart of elements. On top of each square on the chart was a sphere that
represented an element. Keia used the display to enter the number of atoms of
each she would need. Each time she entered a number, a new set of spheres
appeared in front of her. In total, Keia had 4 potassium atoms, 4 aluminum
atoms, 12 silicon atoms, and 128 oxygen atoms. Keia began arranging the
spheres. The metallic tendrils extending from the taserTutor stretched as she
moved her hands from sphere to sphere. First, Keia created 16 tiny pyramids by
sticking 4 oxygen atoms to each aluminum and silicon atom. Then, she combined
the pyramids into 4 rings by removing an oxygen from each pyramid and replacing
it with the oxygen of another pyramid. Next, Keia removed an oxygen to from
each ring to arrange the rings in pairs. After removing an oxygen from each
pair, Keia stacked the pairs on top of each other. Finally, Keia put two
potassium atoms in the middle of the structure and then the last two potassium
atoms on opposites corners of the structure.

"This is the chemical structure of the basic subunit of potassium feldspar."

Keia's arms felt like they were made of feldspar. She was so exhausted that she
almost did not care if she answered correctly or not.

"Describe the mineral composition of the Martian crust. You have 30 seconds to
respond."

"The crust of Mars includes volcanic rock minerals such as feldspars,
pyroxenes, and olivine."

"Explain the origin of nanostructures on the surface of Mars. You have 30
seconds to respond."

"The nanostructures originate from the two sources: the ancient Martian
civilization-"

Keia stopped mid-sentence. She felt like her mouth was filled with Martian
dust. A pulsing red light warned Keia that pauses were not allowed.

"-and Thelusian spacecrafts that collided with Mars during the
Martian-Thelusian War."

Keia looked up. The sky, once dark with orbiting spacecrafts, lit up as the
entire Thelusian armada began to enter the thin Martian atmosphere.

"Compare and contrast the EternalEnlightened with the other branches of
government. You have 30 seconds to respond."

People all around Keia began to run for cover, but she knew there was nowhere
to hide. Everyone was running and screaming except for her and Lita.

"What is Lita doing here on Mars?", Keia wondered.

With an alarmed and desperate look on her face, Lita pointed down in front of
Keia. Unsure why Lita was pointing down and not up at impending cataclysm in
the sky, Keia looked down at the pulsing red light emanating from the metallic
table. Keia's body shook with electricity. Time had run out. Mars was doomed.

"Given that the Venusian orbital period is 225 days, calculate how many days
would pass before Earth and Venus would return to their current positions. You
have 30 seconds to respond."

Keia was having trouble maintain her footing. Beneath her feet, countless
skeletons were crumbling into dust. The dust began to swirl in circles around
Keia, as a ferocious wind built up into a raging storm. In the eye of the
storm, Keia stood staring at the remnants of an extinguished world. When
lightning shot out of storm and struck Keia, she screamed, not in pain, but in
anger.

With the loss of an entire civilization weighing down on her, Keia fell to her
knees. The storm eventually began to subside and through the dust and skeletal
fragments Keia could see the pulsing red warning light of the taserTutor. The
tendrils were still wrapped around her arms. The initiation ceremony was still
ongoing.

Another shock from the tendrils caused Keia to spasm and she hit her head on
the taserTutor. Enraged, Keia stood up to look at the console atop the
taserTutor. There was no way to stop the ceremony once it had begun and
breaking free from the tendrils was impossible. The automated voice continued
providing instructions, but Keia was no longer paying attention. The ceremony
seemed so insignificant when compared to the destruction of Mars. Keia just
wanted it to end. As the taserTutor once again begun to pulse red, Keia used
the virtual keyboard to skip the current task.

The resulting electric shock only added to the fury that Keia felt. As soon as
she could control her fingers again, Keia began skipping task after task,
racing through each subsequent electric shock. Her ears were ringing. Tears
were streaming down her face. Her breathing was hoarse and uneven. The burning
smell was suffocating. Her mouth tasted like it was coated with metal. Rage was
the only thing keeping her going.

Keia kept trying to skip even after the console stopped responding and the
tendrils began to unwrap from around her arms. Bracing against the taserTutor
for support and still focused on the console, Keia was an easy target for the
did not even notice the chaseChimpanzees charging towards her. The
chaseChimpanzees tackled Keia into taserTutor so hard that she bounced off and
ended sprawled on the floor. A guardGorilla lumbered up to Keia, grabbed her by
an ankle, and proceeded to drag her out of the gymnasium.

As she was dragged past the bleachers, Keia looked searched for Lita in the sea
of standing and staring students. The automated voice was already calling the
next student up to the taserTutor. Lita pushed through the densely packed crowd
of students, leapt off the bleachers, and ran towards Keia. When she was a
steps away from Keia, a nearby guardGorilla grabbed Lita by her shirt and
plucked her off the ground. Simultaneously kicking and punching the
guardGorilla, Lita fought to break free. Reaching her hand out to Lita, Keia
tried to say her name, but the sound that came was nothing more than a pitiful
moan.

Suspended in the air, Lita braced her legs against the guardGorilla that was
carrying her and pushed off like a olympic swimmer completing a flip turn.
Lita's shirt ripped and she landed shirtless flat on the ground. Crawling on
her hands and knees, Lita made it Keia and grabbed her outstretched hand.
Seemingly perplexed by the situation, the securitySimians paused for a moment.

Still holding the ripped remains of Lita's shirt, one of the guardGorillas
tried to separate the two friends by grabbing Lita's foot. As the guardGorillas
yank from both ends trying to pull them apart, Lita held on to Keia's hands
with all her strength. When Lita's shoe came off, they hit the ground, Keia on
her back, Lita on her belly, but they remained linked. The guardGorilla holding
Keia's ankle seemed to grow impatient and began to drag the two friends out of
the gymnasium.

"At least now, I won't have to go through the ceremony.", Lita joked.

Despite the pain, Keia smiled. Lita was so brave and strong, always looking out
for Keia and trying to cheer her up. Keia's eyes began to well up. Seeing that
her friend was beginning to cry, Lita tried to strike a jovial tone.

"Was this best plan you could come up with?"

"It's better than the one with the buzzBees and wakeupWasps."

"Yeah, I hate bugs."

Lita laughed at her own joke and Keia's heart melted. Even being dragged
shirtless through a school they would likely soon be expelled from, Lita was
defiant and beautiful. Wishing she could pull Lita closer, Keia became
overwhelmed with emotion and broke down crying.

"Cheer up, at least we're helping to clean to the floor. Maybe we found our
calling? I can be a broom and you can be a mop!"

When Keia continued to cry, Lita decided to double down.

"Okay, okay, you can be the broom and I'll be the mop. Is that better?"

Keia huffed, pretending to be exasperated.

"Admit it. I'm funny! This is the standup comedy show that will redefine the
word standup. Pretty soon every comedian will do shows while being dragged
through the venue."

Keia rolled her eyes.

"Did you hear the one about the guardGorilla, the historianHummingbird, and
buzzBee?"

"A chaseChimpanzee, a surveillanceSloth, and a messengerMeerkat walk into a
bar...", Keia retorted.

"There you go! Maybe we can form a comedy duo? We'll get dragged through all
the best places in town!"

When they arrived at the Principal's office, the guardGorilla let go of Keia's
foot and opened the door. Lita helped Keia to her feet, put Keia's arm around
her shoulder, and walked with her towards the office. Leaning against her
friend, Keia became overwhelmed by the intoxicating scent of Lita's hair and
almost fell over. As they entered the office, they saw the girl with the purple
hair sitting in a chair with a guardGorilla standing behind her.

In the opposite side of the room was a large, well-polished mahogany desk, and behind it sat the
school Principal, snoring loudly with his head tilted back, his mouth open, his
face and neck covered in buzzBees, and drool flowing down the side of his chin.

When she saw the look on the purple-haired girl's bruised face, Keia began to
wonder what she and Lita looked like. Lita, shirtless and missing a shoe, was
supporting Keia whose hair was still standing on end from being electrocuted
countless times. The guardGorilla pulled up a pair of chairs for Keia and Lita.
As soon as she helped Keia sit down in the chair closest to door, Lita crossed
her arms in front of her exposed chest and sat down in the chair in between
Keia and the purple-haired girl. Turning towards the purple-haired girl, Lita
tried to start a conversation.

"I think what you did in the gym was awesome!"

"What the hell happened to you?"

"Keia was doing really well in the ceremony, but then decided to skip the rest
of the taserTutor tasks. She got fried, then the securitySimians got her. I
tried to rescue her, but they got me too and brought us both here."

When the purple-haired girl did not respond, Lita continued.

"My name is Lita. My friend is Keia. What's your name?"

"Dela."

"Hi Dela! I'd shake your hand, but my hands are full."

Lita looked down at her arms, still crossed in front of her chest. "Very full!"
she exclaimed as she wiggled her shoulders and smiled at Dela.

"Can one of you give me a hand?", Lita said looking back and forth between Dela
and Keia.

Is she always like this?, Dela asked looking at Keia.

"Not really. I think she is just happy she got to skip the ceremony."

"Keia got herself fried so I wouldn't have to go through it."

Dela shook her head.

"There are easier ways to skip the ceremony. You should have protested like
me."

"How did you smuggle in that thing that made your voice really loud?", Lita asked.

"The gigaphone? I didn't smuggle it in. I built it inside the gym from pieces
of broken robotic animals."

"Where did you get the tools from?"

"I built the tools I needed from pieces of broken robotic animals."

Pre-empting the next question, Dela responded before Lita could ask.

"Don't ask me where I got the tools to build the tools I needed to build the
gigaphone."

"Can you teach me to build things?", Lita asked.

"I'd only teach you if you were part of the revolution."

"The revolution?"

"The revolution is a movement that will overthrow the government and build a
better world."

"How are we going to do that?"

"Anyway we can! The system of oppression that forces us to-"

As if on cue, the Principal woke up noisily, send buzzBees flying in every
direction. Disoriented and disconcerted, he looked back and forth between the
three girls in his office. Unsure of what to do, the Principal began to tap at
the console on his desk and mumble to himself. Whenever he looked up, it was
always at Lita's chest. His gaze made her so uncomfortable, Lita shrunk back
into her chair and curled up in a ball, bringing her knees up to her chin and
wrapping her arms around her shins.

"Don't put your shoes on my office furniture!", the Principal barked angrily.

"What happened to your other shoe? And what happened to your shirt?", he asked
disapprovingly.

Keia watched helplessly as Lita slipped into a seizure. Luckily, Lita stayed in
fetal position in the chair even though her hands floated to her sides.

"Nevermind, I'm pulling up the recordings.", he said before Lita could respond.

Images of the ceremony showed up on the walls of the Principal's office. Keia
shivered when she saw herself being repeatedly electrocuted. The visions that
were so powerful during the ceremony now seemed so distant and foreign. She saw
that Lita tried to go to Keia after the first few electric shocks, but a
chaseChimpanzee pulled her back to her seat on the bleachers.

Everyone in the room winced when they saw Keia get tackled by a chaseChimpanzee
into the taserTutor. The Principal seemed to be enjoying the show. When Lita's
shirt was ripped off, he bounced in his chair with glee. After the recording
ended, he cleared his throat and put on a serious face.

"The crimes you have committed are very serious. Disruption of the peace,
unsanctioned protest, destruction of school property, indecent exposure,
resisting arrest, assault with a deadly weapon-"

"What weapon?!", Lita exclaimed incredulously.

"The gigaphone is classified as a lethal weapon. And rightly so, it can produce
sounds 1000 times louder than a regular megaphone. If it had been a teraphone,
I could have called in a strike team and had you executed on the spot!"

The Principal's eyes returned to the screen on his desk.

"The EternalEnlightened have reviewed the video evidence related to your case.
The results of your trial should be available any-"

"Possible mitigating circumstances?!", the Principal exclaimed, interrupting himself.

The Principal turned to Keia.

"The EternalEnlightened have asked for more information about your interaction
with the taserTutor. Why did you only provide responses for some of the tasks?
Were you suffering from a psychotic episode? Or were you making a statement
against corporeal punishment in the school system?"

Surprised to suddenly become the center of attention, Keia felt her cheeks become flushed
with embarrassment. She understood the reasoning behind the question. The
school had access to all of her medical records, including her diagnoses. Keia
looked back and forth between Lita and Dela. She wanted to be defiant and
strong like they were. She did not want mental illness to be the reason she got
into the mess. She wanted to be normal.

"It was a protest.", Keia lied. Lita gasped. Dela nodded approvingly.

"Was the protest premeditated? Did you conspired with the other two girls to
stage the protest?", the Principal read off the screen.

"Yes, I planned the whole thing, but on my own. Lita had nothing to do with it!
She's innocent!", Keia said.

"She is hardly innocent. Indecent exposure, interruption of a
government-mandated ceremony, and interference with the arrest of a protester
are serious crimes.", the Principal huffed.

"Lita didn't plan for any of that to happen. She was just trying to help me."

"Is this true that you had no idea about the protest plans and were not trying
to make a political statement?", the Principal asked, turning towards Lita.

Still using her legs to shield herself from the prying eyes of the
Principal, Lita nodded, her chin bouncing against her knees.

Turning to Dela, "Did you conspire with the other girls to stage a protest?",
the Principal asked.

"I never even met them until you brought them in here!", Dela exclaimed.

"We have results!", the Principal shouted and read the verdicts and sentences
one after another.

"Ferdinandela Fridzia, you are found guilty of all charges and are sentenced to
four years in juvenile detention."


"Keiakeilaila Arkadia, you are found guilty of all charges and are sentenced to
three years in juvenile detention."


"Satalitastra Azimuta, you are found guilty of all charges and are sentenced to
one year in juvenile detention."

"Your sentences can be suspended and you can be allowed to begin your high
school studies if you agree to complete the initiation ceremony, perform
community service, and sign a statement disavowing all previous political
statements and activities. You each can each agree or disagree to the sentence
suspension terms. You must decide before leaving this office."

"We should all agree.", Keia said quickly looking at the other two girls.

"I'm not going to agree to anything.", Dela replied dourly.

"If you go to prison, we'll never see you again! If you stay, maybe we can be
friends?"

"I don't want friends, I want to smash the system!"

"You can't start a revolution from inside prison.", Lita said.

"I don't care. I stand by what I did and said."

While Lita kept trying to convince Dela, Keia looked at the Principal, who had
zoned out and tapping listlessly on his desk console.

"He wants you to refuse, so he can send you to prison and not have
to deal with you! Are you just going to give him what he wants?"

When Dela did not answer, Keia got the Principal's attention.

"Principal Naksos, what do you think we should do?"

The Principal looked up from the console and looked confused.

"What decision do you think we should make? Should we accept or refuse?"

"I would encourage you to not compromise your deeply held beliefs. It is very
likely you would all end up in prison anyway, so refusing the sentence
suspension terms would save everyone a great deal of time and effort."

"Thank you for sharing your thoughts.", Keia said, "but I think we're all
going to agree to the terms."

"Accepting the terms will be extremely bothersome for everyone. First, we would
have to deal with the disavowal statements. Then, you all will have to go
through the initiation ceremony, find community service opportunities, and
complete the required community service hours in addition to your studies."

"That honestly sounds better than going to prison.", Lita said.

"If you accept the terms, I can assure you that high school will be a living
hell for you. Given the events that occurred today, it is almost certain that
you will be ostracized by your peers and targeted by bullies. It won't be too
long before you will be wishing for peace and quiet of the penal system."

"Why are you trying so hard to convince us to refuse?", Dela asked.

"Your chances of success in high school are close to non-existent and your
chances of finding employment after high school are even lower. Even if you do
everything perfectly, you will still end up in prison sooner or later after
prolonged unemployment. The automatic background checks will always point the
recordings from the ceremony today. Do you really think anyone would want to
hire you after seeing what happened?"

The Principal replayed the recordings of the ceremony on the walls of his
office.

"I've seen a lot of students go through this school and I can always predict
which students will end up as prison laborers. Well, since the vast majority of
public school students end up in the penal system, I would be correct most of
the time even if I blindly guessed that everyone would go to prison.
Nevertheless, you can trust me when I say by accepting the terms you will only
be setting yourselves up for disappointment."

"It's better to try and fail, then to never try at all.", Lita said.

"I disagree. The penal system is really not that bad. Plenty of people go to
prison voluntarily to avoid the perils of a life in poverty. In prison, you
will be guaranteed ample food, water, heat, and oxygen, as long as you work. I
hear weightlessness is great fun and the views are majestic. After a few years
in prison, you will become physiologically adapted to space and you won't even
want to return to Earth."

"If it's so great, why don't you go?", Dela asked sarcastically.

The Principal cleared his throat nervously.

"I am needed here. My sacred duty of molding young minds is of utmost
importance. Of course, I also cannot abandon my dear son Pyr."

The Principal called up an image of a young man flexing his muscles and
sticking out his tongue.

"That's the guy who was heckling us during the ceremony!", Lita exclaimed.

"He is quite the precocious young man.", the Principal said fondly.

"If your son were in our situation, would you recommend that he enter the penal
system too?", Keia asked.

"Of course not!", the Principal shouted, turning red and getting flustered.

"Pyrik has a bright future ahead of him! I would never send him to rot in
that-"

The Principal stopped when he realized that he was hurting his own argument.

"Don't you think it might be better to accept the terms, Dela?", Keia asked.

"Fine, I'll accept, but that doesn't mean I'm going to be friends with you two
losers.", Dela huffed.

"I can tell we're going to get along swimmingly.", Lita quipped.

"We are ready to sign the statements.", Keia said to the Principal, trying to
move things along before Dela had a chance to change her mind.

"I truly believe you are making a mistake.", the Principal said shaking his head.

Seeing that the girls were adamant, the Principal sighed and brought up three
copies of the disavowal statement on the desk, one in front of each girl.

"Go ahead and sign, but don't come complaining to me when you inevitably fail."

The three girls started scrolling through statements, carefully reading each
word.

Keia finished reading first. "Why does the-"

"The statement text is non-negotiable.", the Principal said sharply, cutting Keia off.

"But I don't under-"

"If your families could afford attorneys, they would have paid into your school
accounts. It is not my job to explain legalese to you. I told you that
accepting the terms was going to be a huge burden on everyone!"

After going over the statement again, Keia placed her palms on the desk to sign
the statement. A few moments later, Lita did the same. The two girls turned
their attention to Dela, who was staring at the statement with clenched fists.

When Dela noticed the other two girls looking at her, she exploded.

"This is bull-"

"Just sign it already, so we can get out of here!", Lita pleaded.

Dela slammed her palms on the desk to sign the statement and proceeded to kick
the desk repeatedly.

"That's real mahogany!", the Principal lamented.

"Come on. Help me lift Keia.", Lita said pulling Dela with one hand and
covering herself with the other hand.

As soon as Lita got up from her chair, the Principal became entranced and soon
forgot about any damage that his desk might have sustained.

Exiting the Principal's office required a team effort. It took all of Keia's
strength just to hold onto the other girls. With Lita trying to cover herself,
it was up to Dela to open the door. As soon as they made it past the door, they
were greeted by a familiar voice.

"Hey guys, who ordered the lesbo sandwich with butch bread?"

A handful of boys started laughing and exchanging high-fives in front of the
office door. The boy had been waiting for the three girls to exit. The girls
recognized that the boy speaking to them was Pyr.

"If you play your cards right, I might add some of my special sauce to your crappy
sandwich."

The boys went berserk with laughter.

"You had all that time since the ceremony and that was the best you could come
up with?" Dela asked.

Looking over at Lita, Keia noticed that her friend was having a seizure. Keia
watched powerlessly as the hand that was covering Lita's chest drifted down in
the front of her.

"Look fellas, this one is ready for me.", said Pyr as he moved forward with
his hands reaching out towards Lita's chest. Dela swung at Pyr with her free
hand, while kicking him in the shins. Keia tried to pull Lita back away from
Pyr, but was too weak to move Lita very far. Keia opened her mouth to scream
for help, but before she could make a sound, a historianHummingbird crashed
into the side of Pyr's face, sending him crashing to the floor.

Dela gave Pyr one more kick before pulling the other two girls through the
semicircle of stunned boys. After Lita recovered, she was dazed and confused,
but she understood the need to run. Keia's feet could barely keep from dragging
on the ground while the other two girls carried her down the hallway.

"Let's head to the theater.", Dela said, "It's dark inside and there are plenty
of places to hide."

Once inside the theater, the girls got up on the stage and hid behind the
curtains, trying to catch their breath. They were all tired, but still very
much on-edge. They all jumped when they noticed a set of four glowing eyes, in
the same configuration as a brown recluse spider, staring at the them. From the
darkness, a sweet voice rang out.

"Sorry to startle you. No one ever comes to visit us. Please wait one moment
while we turn on the lights. You might want to cover your eyes until they
adjust.", said a sweet voice.

When the lights came on, the girls saw a boy and girl, dressed in matching black
jumpsuits. The boy seemed very awkward and reserved, while the girl carried
herself with confidence.

"Welcome to the theater!" , the girl proclaimed with a flourish.

"What the hell are you?", Dela said sharply.

"Apologies, I am not sure what you mean.", the girl replied.

"Your eyes were glowing in the dark.", Lita explained.

"And you looked like a spider." Keia added.

"I can assure you that we are not spiders.", the girl replied.

"Why do your eyes glow in the dark?", Lita persisted.

"I think you were seeing things. Sometimes when people are afraid of the dark,
their minds play tricks on them.", the girl replied.

"Cut the crap. We all saw it." Dela said advancing menacingly towards the girl.
"You're Lunkers, aren't you? If you try to lie to us-"

"You mustn't tell anyone anything!", the girl replied.

"It makes sense that Lunkers would want to work in a dark theater. It must
remind you of home.", Lita offered.

"Explain the spider eyes.", Dela said letting go of Keia and holding up two
fingers on each hand next to her eyes.

After realizing what Dela meant, the boy and girl put their arms around each
other and tilted their heads together.

"We walk together like this because it enhances our night vision.", the girl
explained.

"You two look really cute together.", Lita said smiling at them warmly.

"Ha, I think the night vision enhancement isn't the only reason they can't keep
their hands off of each other.", Dela said laughing.

The boy and the girl separated, looking very embarrassed.

"We are brother and sister!", the boy blurted out.

Dela did not relent. "Oh, you two are naughty! Is incest normal for Lunkers?"

"Stop it, Dela.", Keia said, kicking her.

"What are your names?", Lita said, trying to smooth things over.

"My name is Aira.", said the girl.

"I am Ryn.", said the boy.

"I'm Lita, this is Keia, and next to her is Dela. Nice to meet you both. I'd
shake your hands, but my hands are full.", Lita said.

"Don't say it.", Dela warned.

"Do you want me to lend you a shirt from the theater?" Aira said to Lita.

Lita nodded emphatically.

"Do you want to come with me to dressing room so you can try a few things on?"

Lita looked at Keia. "Keia is hurt, do you have a place she can rest?"

"Yeah, I would love to not have to lug this loser around anymore.", Dela added.

"Yes, there is, but you mustn't tell anyone anything.", Aira said.

"We get the idea.", Dela said flatly, "We're not going to tell anyone anything."

"Ok, Ryn and I built a secret bed so we could sleep in the theater during
breaks from work."

During the awkward silence that ensued, Keia saw Lita was tempted to make a
joke but held back. Unlike Lita, Dela couldn't resist.

"You have a secret bed? That you built yourselves, so you could sleep together?
Is that a normal thing for Lunkers?", Dela asked smiling mischievously.

Ryn was so embarrassed, he started to stammer. Dela didn't relent.

"How long have you been sleeping together? Is the sleep still good? Are you
doing anything to spice it up? Trying out a new pillow, maybe?"

Keia was furious. "They're trying to help us and you keep bullying them!"

"Ryn, show Dela and Keia were the bed is hidden. I'll take Lita to the dressing
room."

"We saw the recording of the ceremony today. We think you are all very brave.",
Ryn said trying to diffuse the situation. "I thought the gigaphone you built
was great. I like making things too.", Ryn said to Dela shyly.

Dela waited until Lita and Aira were out of earshot. "Have you built any
special recently? Maybe a device to help your sister sleep?" Dela continued,
"Something to knock her out so you can knock her up!"

"Stop it!", Keia yelled.

"When you sleep together, does she snore really loud? Do you have to cover her
mouth to keep the whole school from hearing?"

"That's enough!", Keia screamed pushing Dela away. Not having the strength to
stand on her own, Keia fell to her knees. Dela was not done yet.

"Keia, are you sure you even want to lay down in the secret bed? It must be
covered with sleep stains!"

Keia began to cry, feeling powerless to stop Dela.

"When's the last time you cleaned the sheets? Wait, have you ever cleaned the
sheets? I bet we can find it just by the smell!"

Ryn helped Keia to her feet and started walking with her in the direction of the secret bed.

"Have you ever been this close to a girl that wasn't your sister? Be careful,
Ryn, your sister might get jealous! She's used to having you all to herself,
she might not like sharing you with Keia."

Dela continued to taunt Ryn all the way to secret bed. Lita and Aira were
already there waiting for them.

"What took you so long? I was worried", Lita said.

Keia didn't respond, she just looked angrily at Dela. Sensing the tension, Lita
tried to change the subject.

"How do I look?", Lita asked.

Lita twirl and struck a pose. She was wearing a long flowing shirt
covered by an elegant bodice. The sight of Lita took Keia's breath away.

"Like a guardGorilla in a milk maid outfit.", Dela said.

"What is it with you?", Keia screamed lunging at Dela. Dela stepped away
effortlessly. Keia stumbled and fell, landing on her hands and knees.

"Looks like I hit a nerve! I've been making fun of Ryn for ages without much of a
response. Then, I say one harmless thing about Lita and Keia flips out."

"Sorry Ryn, looks like Keia only cares about Lita, I guess you are stuck with
your sister for now."

Keia couldn't hear Dela anymore over the howling wind tearing through the
theater. Sifting through the dust on the floor with her fingers, Keia pulled
out assorted fragments of bone and shook them in her hand like dice. Through
the dust swirling around Keia, she saw the metallic glint of the taserTutor.
The metallic tendrils extending from taserTutor were coiled around her arms up
to the shoulder. The ceremony was still ongoing. The taserTutor began to pulse
red. Keia's heart sunk. Had she imagined everything? Dela, the Principal, Pyr,
Ryn, Aira? Lightning shot out of the surrounding storm and coursed through
Keia's body. Keia screamed and writhed on the ground, but then got up with a
renewed sense of purpose.

Did she have a chance to change the future? If she answered the remaining
questions, could she turn everything around? Keia knew what she had to do. She
would continue through the ceremony, deny any political motivations, blame
everything on her mental illness, and anything else she needed to do to keep
Lita safe, even if it meant that Dela would go to prison for years. Keia began
to feverishly work on the problem displayed on the console.

She nearly finished with the task when the tendrils started restricting her
movements and moving up past her shoulder. The tendrils wrapped her neck and
around her head. She braced her legs against the taserTutor and pushed as hard
as she could, trying to break free of the tendrils. New tendrils extended out
of taserTutor wrapping around her legs. Before long, Keia was encased head to
foot in tendrils. The tendrils constricted, squeezing all of the moisture out
of her body. When the final drop of blood disappeared in the swirling dust
below, Keia had been squeezed dry and her mummification was complete.

Roving the desolate wasteland of Mars, Keia was a vengeful spirit in search of
her next victim. She hunted the new invaders, the ones who desecrated the
remains of her people in search of riches. When the invaders began to arrive
with greater frequency, she raised an army of the dead to repel them. Sitting
victorious atop her throne, she waited for the next opportunity to fertilize
the barren soil of Mars with blood of her enemies. This is was Keia's fate.
This is how she would remain. In a perpetual cycle of death and waiting, Keia
would protect the memory of her lost civilization from each new crop of fools
who sought to strike gold on the red planet.

Disturbed by an unfamiliar sensation on her forehead, the Dust Queen let out
her anger in a roar that shook the ground. After probing her face with an
tendril-covered hand, she inspected her hand and was stunned to see that her
fingers were moist. Where had the moisture come from? She had not had even a
drop of blood in her for eons, she was dessicated to the core. What was going
on? Tiny drops of water were falling down on the Dust Queen's face wherever
she went. How could there be rain on Mars? She looked up and saw the
constellations rearranging into a face that filled the heavens. The Dust Queen
recognized the face in the stars. It was Lita. The raindrops were coming from
her.

"Come back to me, please.", the sky whispered. It was no use. There was nothing
left of Keia. The Dust Queen was not going to spring back to life from a few
drops of water! The sky sighed and began to squeeze the horizons until the land
where the Dust Queen stood disappeared completely and the Dust Queen was left
floating in the void. The constellations warped and stretched until they formed
a single brilliant ball of light. The ball of light grew arms, legs, and a
head, taking the form of Lita. Lita reached her hand out to the Dust Queen and
the tendrils began to break apart, revealing the dried out cadaver underneath.

"Keia.", Lita said. "Yes", the Dust Queen thought, "that was once my name. In
a past life? Or a future one?"

The light began to burn away her parched skin and brittle bones. Beneath it
all, a dim flicker of light began to shine. Could I still be saved? Lita cupped
her hands around the flicker and blew into it gently. Each time Lita blew into
her hands, the flicker grew stronger, eventually growing into a flame. As Lita
drew in breath, Keia reached out from inside the flame and gently touched the
sides of Lita's face. When Lita leaned into blow on the flame again, Keia
pulled her in and kissed her on the lips, sucking her life giving breathe deep
into her lungs.

Keia's body convulsed on the hard concrete floor of the theater. She was
hyperventilating, in a panic. Lita lifted Keia's head up off the ground and
cradled it in her arms. She smoothed Keia's hair with one hand and supported
Keia's neck with the other. Soon the convulsions were replaced by shivers and
Keia's eyes focused on Lita's face. Still trembling, Keia looked up at Lita.
Tears were falling from Lita's eyes onto Keia's face.

"Is she alive?", Dela asked impatiently.

"Yes. No thanks to you.", Lita replied sharply.

"Let's get her into bed.", Aira said.

Keia was underwater, looking up at Lita in the stars above. An octopus obscured
the view of the sky and Keia tried to shoo it away, but it extended four pairs
of tentacles towards Keia and carried her with to onto a tuft of seaweed. Keia
suddenly felt very grateful to the octopus. Reaching out her hands, she began
to caress the tentacles. The tentacles began to reciprocate. Keia was
blissfully exchanging caresses with the octopus when she had a startling
thought. If I'm underwater, how is it that I'm breathing? Keia shot up,
throwing the tentacles off of her, and gasping for air.

"It's ok, Keia.", Lita said reassuringly, "You're safe now."

Lita laid down next to Keia in the bed, cradling Keia in her arms. Keia buried
her face in Lita's shirt just above the bodice. The smell of the starchy shirt
mixing with Lita's scent was heavenly. Soon Keia stopped trembling and her body
relaxed. Keia lifted her face up to look at Lita. Lita was so radiant and
beautiful that Keia began to cry.

Lita leaned in a kissed Keia's cheeks, catching the fresh tears with her lips.
Keia fell asleep with a smile on her face as Lita slowly showered her with
kisses. The blissful look on Keia's face warmed Lita's heart. They were
together. They were safe, at least for now. The world melted away. Lita did not
realize how she was exhausted until now. With one arm still around Keia, Lita
tugged futilely at the bindings of her bodice.

"Let me help you", Aira said, as she deftly undid the bindings of the bodice
and pulled it out from under Lita. This kind gesture surprised Lita so much
that she began to cry. Through the tears, Lita looked at Aira with gratitude.

"Don't cry.", Aira said, unfastening and removing Lita's heels and then pulling
up the blankets to cover Keia and Lita, "You're safe here and I'll stay and
watch over you."

Unable to recall anyone other than Keia being kind to her, Lita let out a sob.
Afraid she had said something wrong, Aira stepped backwards.

"I'm going to turn off the lights."

As the theater descended into darkness, Lita snuggled up to Keia, greedily
interlacing their legs and pulling Keia closer with her arms. Recalling how
Keia often breathed in deep when they hugged, Lita rested her nose on top of
Keia's head and filled her lungs with the scent of Keia's hair. The darkness
around Lita exploded with a kaleidoscope of shimmering colors. With another
breath, Lita began to float in between the colors as they gently twinkled
around her. By the third breath, Lita was in another plane of existence
entirely, gently drifting off to sleep in the arms of her lifelong best friend.

## Chapter 2

"Why am I like this?", Dela thought as she covered her mouth so no one would
hear her crying. She had been drifting in and out of sleep on the hard concrete
floor of the theater, but she could not stop thinking of Keia writhing on the
ground during her psychotic episode. The screams were bad, but the low dull
wailing that followed was somehow worse. It was as if Keia had a demon inside
her trying to claw its way out. Lita held onto Keia the whole time, having
seizures one after another. During the seizures, Lita's eyes stayed open, the
look of concern on her face would melt away, she would stare off into void.
When Keia stopped breathing, Lita responded immediately by giving her CPR. Did
Lita already know what to do, because she had been in this situation before?
Dela felt absolutely powerless. She had never known anyone like Lita and Keia.
Was she responsible for what happened?

"It's not my fault that they're like that.", Dela thought to herself, getting
up off the ground and looking at Keia and Lita lying peacefully in the secret
bed. Dela wanted to lay down in the secret bed next to them, it looked really
nice, but she was wracked by feelings of guilt and did not feel she deserved to
be comfortable.

"I don't need sleep. Beds are for the weak. The only thing that matters is the
revolution.", Dela thought as she got up and started trying to find her way out
of the theater in complete darkness. With each step, she probed the ground
beneath her. She hadn't gotten very far when she noticed two glowing eyes
observing her in the darkness.

"You know you're creepy as hell.", Dela said.

"Yes, I am aware of that. I am still learning how to interact with topsiders. My
sister is much better. She is a people person.", Ryn answered.

"Well, then bring her here. I'd rather talk to her."

"She is watching over Lita and Keia. If they wake up in the darkness-"

"Shut up, turn on a flashlight, and show me the way out of here."

Ryn complied immediately. "Would you like to see the machine workshop?"

"Was he still trying to be friends with her?", Dela thought, "What a loser!".

Not having any other plan, Dela nodded. The machine workshop would be a welcome
distraction.

Arriving at the machine shop, Dela was dumbstruck at how technologically
advanced and well stocked it was.

"I was not expecting this place to be halfway decent. Everything else in the
crappy school is absolutely worthless."

"Ben and Ed's family finances the machine shop but do not provide funding for
any other part of the school."

"Who are Ben and Ed?"

"They are my friends. Ben is really smart. Ed is really big and strong."

Dela laughed. "And they have money to burn on all of this?"

"Their parents are high ranking members of the CorporateCouncil."

"If they're so rich, why do they go to a run-down public school?"

"I do not know.", Ryn said walking up to a console, "I ask them to come here so
you can ask."

It was no long before a thin boy wearing powerskates zipped into the machine
shop with another boy nearly as large as a guardGorilla running in after him.
him. The boy in power skates did a sliding stop right in front of Dela and Ryn
and the other boy ran up and stopped a few steps behind him. Reaching out one
hand to Dela and gesturing around the machine workshop with the other, "Welcome
to the machine shop!", the boy in power skates said. He was wearing metallic
gloves covered with intricate patterns.

Turning one begloved hand towards himself, "I'm Ben." and the other begloved
hand to boy behind him "and this is my little brother Ed.", bowing deeply "and
we are both deeply honored to be at your service."

"This is Dela.", Ryn said, "She likes making things too!"

"The gigaphone you built was impressive, considering the limited resources you
had at your disposal.", Ed said. "Just think of what you could build in the
machine workshop!"

"I can use all this stuff?", Dela asked.

"Yes, of course! Let me show you around." Ed
replied.

"You can use any free workstation you like.", Ed said sweeping his hand across
the workshop, then turning towards a console, "You can also reserve any
workstation for any period of time,", holding up one finger on one hand, "but
you can only reserve one workstation at a time.".

"The reservation schedule looks mostly empty. Actually, you and Ryn are the
only ones making reservations. Do people mostly use whatever workstation is
available?

Ben looked a little uncomfortable. "The workshop is criminally underutilized.
The school does not require anyone to use it and it seems that making things is
not everyone's cup of tea. I hold biweekly maker interest group (MIG) meetings
that are open to everyone, but admittedly the attendance is very poor."

"Maybe more people would show up if you made the meetings secret and exclusive.
People like being part of inside groups."

Ben stopped for a moment and began to scribble notes on his palm with his finger.

"That's brilliant!" Looking up from his palm, "Would you like to be the first
member of our newly formed secret maker interest group?"

"Sure.", Dela replied casually.

"Excellent!" Ben responded opening a large cabinet. "I just gave you full
access to the workshop. You can use any of the tools as long as you follow the workshop
rules."

"What are the rules?"

Ben brought up an image on the wall that said,
MACHINE WORKSHOP RULES
1. Do not intentionally kill, maim, or otherwise injury any living thing.

"Is there just one rule?"

"For now. To be honest, I couldn't think of any others."

"What about stealing?"

"Every item has a tracker and everything in the entire school is recorded, so I
don't think that will be necessary. If a MIG member steals anything, we will
know and can revoke their access immediately."

"What about destruction of property?"

"Property can be replaced. Sometimes property gets destroyed during testing of
new inventions. I do not think protection of property should be a priority.
Again, if a MIG member acts maliciously, we can always revoke their access."

Question about Pyr and the bird

Ben makes a matching set of powergloves for Dela. She puts on powerskates and
the new powergloves and Ben teaches her the ancient MakerMixedMartialArts
moves that he made up himself.

"How is it ancient if you made it up yourself?"

"Sorry, you're right. It just sounds better if martial arts are ancient."

Dela is impressed by the immense power that the gloves hold. She asks if there
are any failsafes.

Ben shows her how the gloves can be deactivated. Dela deactivates Ben's gloves
and asks if she did it right. Ben is impressed that Dela did it correctly on
her first try. He asks her to reactivate his gloves, but she deactivates all of
his security access and sends buzzBees to knock out Ben, Ed, and Ryn. Ed is
immune to the sedatives and chases her. She is amazed that he can keep up with
her and commands guardGorillas to slow him down. Dela heads to the Principal's
office to strongarm him into requesting a pardon. She stands on his desk and
holds an activated powerskate next to his face. The Principal vomits all the
skate short-circuiting it.

...

Placing one of her powerskates on his chest and leaning in as if she was
stretching her psoas muscle, Dela looked at the Principal menacingly.

"I want you a full pardon for me and the other girls."

"I don't haf that aufority!"

"Then you better find someone who does or I'm going to powerskate all over face
while the guardGorillas hold you down."

"Your bluffing."

"Are you sure? Take your time trying to figure it out, I'm not in a rush."

"A shtrike team hash already been dishpatched."

"Are they really going to charge in her just to save a buzzBee-addicted
Principal who lost control of school?"

The Principal cleared his throat, and said "I can requesht a pardon from the
E-" before vomiting all over Dela's leg.

Dela recoiled in horror, then she instinctively kicked the Principal in the
face, sending vomit flying in all directions.

"Request the pardon now!"

The Principal wiped his face with the sleeve of his blazer and started entering
the pardon requests as Dela stood over him making sure he did not try any
tricks. The pardon requests were approved soon after the Principal submitted
them. Dela hopped off the desk next to the Principal and read through each one
of the pardons.

"Great, now there a few other things I want to do. I'm going to replace all of
the recordings of me and the other girls with fakes that show us all doing
really well in the initiation ceremony. I know I can't replace any local
copies that anyone downloaded, but with the digital watermark from console no
one will be able to say which version is the real one."

"While the fakes are being generated let's see what else I can do"

"Fire alarm. Sprinklers. Deactivate all animalAutomatons. Self-destruct?"

"No, not the shelf-deshtruct!"

The self-destruct alarm alerts Ben, Ed, and Ryn, who find Dela outside the Principal's
office, having guardGorillas carry the Principal.

Ben and Ed try to force her to deactivate the school self-destruct system. Ed
wrestles guardGorillas, Ben uses powerskates and taser batons, but Ed leaves
when Ben is knocked unconscious. Dela faces off against Ben and Ed, Ryn
deactivates the lights trying to gain an advantage over Dela. Ryn stays to stop
Dela, she laughs at him for being a weakling, and when Kaia had guardGorillas
break a hole in the wall to get some light, Ryn summons birds to fight the
robotic animals. Dela is terrified but she finds
Ryn in the darkness by his glowing eyes and kicks him repeatedly in the face
with the vomit covered powerskate.



### Ryn and Dela

"The things you said earlier really hurt-"

"Shut up. I don't care. Just show me the way out."

Ryn drew in a big breathe. "I'm not going to help you until you apologize and
agree to be nicer to me."

"I'm not going to apologize!"

"Then fumble around in the darkness by yourself." Ryn said, turning around to
leave.

"Wait!" Dela said, "If you don't help me, I'm going to tell everyone about your
secret bed."

Ryn turned around, his eyes wide with shock.

"I'll also make sure everyone knows you sleep with your sister."

Ryn whimpered and started crying. The glow from his eyes
illuminated the tears rolling down his cheeks until they disappeared in the
darkness.

"Stop crying and get me out of here!"

Wiping his eyes, Ryn walked closer to Dela.

"What the hell are you doing?"

"I'm going to guide you to the exit."

"Hell no, just turn on the lights!"

"The light might wake up Keia and Dela."

"Ok, then go get a flashlight."

"Aira has it and we only have one. She needs it in case Keia and Dela-."

"How the hell are you planning to get me out of here?"

"I can guide you out if you just hold my hand."

"You're crazy, I'm not holding your hand. We're not in preschool."

"Are as you afraid of holding hands as you are afraid of the dark?"

"I'm not afraid of anything!"

"Then will you let me help you?"

"Fine, just get me out of here!"

Ryn's hand was suprisingly calloused and strong, his grip on Dela's hand was
gentle but firm. He walked slowly because Dela still felt uncertain about
walking in the dark.

"You hands are quite manly hands, considering you are such a wimp."

"It's from working on the theater sets. Aira and I build them all ourselves."

"Have you ever even held hands with a girl before? Other than your sister, of
course."

Ryn stopped for a second, "What is the significance of holding a girl's hand?",
he asked.

Dela laughed in his face or at least where she assumed his face was based on
the position of his eyes. She stopped laughing when she realized that Ryn was
being serious.

"You really don't know?!"

Ryn looked down in embarrassment.

"People hold hands when they're going out together."

"Yes, we are holding hands and we are going out of the theater together."

"No, I mean going out as in they're boyfriend and girlfriend."

"Are Keia and Lita boyfriend and girlfriend?"

"No, they're both girls! Can't you tell?!"

"I can. I am just not sure about the words. People can be friends, but
sometimes when they say boyfriend and girlfriend, it means something
different."

"What do Lunkers say instead of boyfriend and girlfriend?"

"I think we say mate."

"Lunkers are weird."

"I think it is weird that topsiders say things that they know are not true or
say things to hurt each other on purpose."

"Are you talking about lies and insults?"

"Yes, those are the words."

"Do Lunkers always tell the truth and never insult each other?"

"If someone believes that telling lies can help others, then I can at least
understand the logic behind deception, even if I disagree, but I do not
understand the point of insults at all. I might say another to another Lunker
that I dislike the sound of their voice, but that is irrelevant. If I said to
another Lunker that their eyes glow dimly in the darkness, it would be out of
genuine concern for their wellbeing, not an insult. I think living in the darkness
helps us to build compassion."

"If you don't know how to lie, you are going to believe every lie you hear. If
you don't know how to insult someone, you won't know know how to defend
yourself."

Ryn was quiet for a while. Dela realized that they had been talking in the dark
for a long time.

"Keep walking.", Dela said shaking Ryn's hand to indicate urgency. Ryn complied.

"Can you teach me to lie to others and insult them?", Ryn asked shyly.

Dela laughed again, but this time with less malice.

"I'll only teach you if join the revolution."

"The revolution?"

"We're going to overthrow the government!"

"The government is not nice to Lunkers. They search our caves for precious
minerals with blindingly bright lights. If they find anything, we have to move
our settlements to avoid the drilling machines."

"In the new world we are going to build, there will be justice for everyone,
even Lunkers."

"If I can help people by joining your revolution, then I am happy to do so."

"I'm not sure what a wimp like you is going to be able to contribute, but maybe
you can at least be good cannon fodder."

"What is cannon fodder?"

"It's when expendable people are used to absorb enemy fire."

"I am starting to think you do not care much about others."

"I don't care what you think. Are we almost there yet? I feel like we are going
in circles."

"That is because we are going in circles."

"What?"

"I have been practicing deception to try to understand your motivations, elicit
sympathy in you, and to learn more about topsiders in general."

"You dirty moleman!", Dela screamed at Ryn, throwing his hand off to the side.

"Did you know that Lunkers do not consider the word 'moleman' to be an insult?
It sounds like molmin, a Lunker word meaning well-crafted or done with
purpose and skill."

"I don't care about your stupid language!"

"The word 'Lunker' was actually considered a slur until the government made it
the official name for our people."

"Nobody cares about Lunkers, because you are all pushovers!"

"If we try to resist the government, they release poisonous gas into our
tunnels. The gas burns our skin, especially our eyes. If anyone breathes it in,
they die. The gas poisons our food and water. Even with filter masks, we-"

"You all deserve to be gassed, you filthy Lunker molemen!"

Ryn covered his face with his hands as he started sobbing violently. With Ryn's
eyes closed, the darkness in front of Dela was complete.

"They all died." he whimpered, falling to the ground and shaking
uncontrollably. "Aira and I were the only ones who made it. The gas was
clogging the filters and everyone was suffocating. They gave us all their spare
filters and helped us get out even though they could not breathe. We left them
behind to save ourselves. I still see their melted faces whenever I close my
eyes."

Dela stood over Ryn with tears in her eyes. She was angry at Ryn for being so
weak and angry at herself for crying and wasting time on such a weakling. "If
Lunkers are so easy to kill, maybe they deserve it.", Dela thought. She wiped
her face and used the sound of crying to locate Ryn's head. She kicked out her
foot and was surprised at how solidly her shoe connect with the source of the
crying.

"Stop crying and get up!"

When Ryn kept crying, Dela was furious. She kicked him repeatedly until she was
gasping for breath from the exertion. Ryn was not making any sound whatsoever.
Dela dropped to her hands and knees, listening for breathing or any signs of
life.

"Are you concerned for my wellbeing?", Ryn asked, scaring Dela.

"No!", Dela replied, punching Ryn in one of the eyes he had just opened.

It was silent and dark for a while before Ryn spoke again.

"I am sorry for crying. I can still help you, but could you stop hurting me
please? If my eyes swell up more, I will not be able to see in the dark."

Dela stood up and gave Ryn another kick. "I will stop hurting you when stop
being such a weakling. Now get up!"

Ryn got up and shrunk away from Dela. The shape of his eyes were different.
"His eyes really are swollen.", Dela thought realizing that she had been
kicking Ryn in the face.

"Help me out of here or I will smash up your face so much we'll both be stuck
here."

This time Ryn did not delay in taking Dela to the exit. When they moved past
the last curtain. Dela looked Ryn who was shielding his eyes from the light.
His face was swollen and covered with bruises. Was he not defending himself at
all from her kicks? Ryn turned around to leave.

"Oh no, you're not off the hook yet.", Dela said.

Ryn froze, then turned around with a pitiful look on his face.

"Please, no more.", he mumbled.

"I need to destroy a taserTutor, actually burning down the entire gym down
will be better, and you're going to help me."

"No, I can't." Ryn pleaded.

"If you don't, I will tell everyone about your filthy, incestuous relationship
with your sister."

"No, it's not true."

"I'll help the bullies beat you and your sister into a pulp."

"Please no. Please don't hurt Aira." Ryn said crying.

"No crying!", Dela yelled slapping Ryn in the face, "Or I'll rip her apart and
make you watch."

Ryn bit his knuckle to bring himself under control.

"Ok, I'll do anything, but please don't hurt Aira.", his voice quivering.

"Get moving. We can't waste anymore time" Dela said shoving Ryn out the door of
the theater.

Outside the theater, Ryn took a long time to get used to bright lights. Dela
realized that both of their faces were covered with bruises and that they were
attracting the attention of nearby students.

"Come on, people are starting to stare at your stupid, swollen face."

"I am sorry my face is swollen."

"You've never looked better. Now move or I'll make a few more improvements."

"How are you going to burn down the gymnasium?"

"You mean, how are WE going to burn down the gym. WE are going to overload all
of the power cells in all of the robotic animals."

"But that will cause a huge explosion!"

"If we're lucky. Now keep your voice down or someone will hear us."

"There are people in the gymnasium. The ceremony is still ongoing."

"I don't care about them."

"I won't let anyone get hurt. What if we set off the fire alarm before the
explosion?"

"Sure, that's fine as long as the taserTutor is destroyed."

"Ok, but you mustn't tell anyone anything.", Ryn said.

When Dela nodded, Ryn led her down several hallways and up to a set of windows.

"Help me open all the windows.", Ryn said.

"You can kill yourself after we blow up the gym, not before."

"I don't want to kill myself. I just want to create a diversion."

"What?"

"Just help me it will be faster if we work together."

After opening all the windows, Dela grew impatient when nothing happened.

"What are we waiting for? Why are we wasting time just standing her?"

"Please wait.", Ryn said with eyes closed.

"What the hell are you doing? Snap out of it.", Dela said grabbing his
shoulders and shaking him.

"I'm creating a diversion."

"By standing next to a window with your eyes closed? Are you a lizard that
needs sit in the sun to stay warm? Are you making food from the sunlight like a
plant?"

"How did you know I can photosynthesize?", Ryn asked opening his eyes wide in
shock. When Ryn realized that Dela did not know that he could photosynthesize
until he gave it away, he got flustered.

"You mustn't tell anyone anything!", Ryn exclaimed.

"Fine! Just hurry it up with your diversion."

"Ok, it's ready. Now move away from window."

"First, we need to stand next to window and now we need to move away? What the
hell are you-"

Ryn grabbed Dela's hand, pulled her into a corner, and used his body to shield
her from the flood of birds that were flying in through the open windows.

When the birds passed, Ryn pulled Dela out of the corner and ran with her down
the hallway after the mass of birds. All through the hallways, robotic animals
fought with the birds. Ryn ran up to a door and placed his palms on the door
and brought his closer for a retina scan. They went through the open door and saw an empty room with a large table in the center. As the door closed behind them, the sounds of the chaotic battle in the hallway faded away and an automated voice greeted them.

"Welcome Principal Naksos.", the voice said.

"What?", Dela asked.

"I gave myself the Principal's fingerprints and retinas, so I could access
any system in the school. You mustn't tell anyone anything."

"That's actually kinda awesome.", Dela admitted.

"I will do anything to protect Aira.", Ryn said getting emotional again.

"Ok, I get it. Let's get this over with."

"I am going to unlock the control center. You start the fire alarm and I will
detonate the robotic animals after everyone is clear."

Ryn used his palms and eyes to activate the table. When Dela walked up to it, a
console appeared. She had administrative access to the entire school system.
Dela did not waste any time setting off the first alarm. Ryn was busy working
on the console. First, he had the taserTutor release the student currently
going through the ceremony. Then, he had the automated voice tell everyone to
evacuate. Finally, he had all of the robotic animals surround the taserTutor
before sending the command for them to detonate.

"It is done. We should go now."

"Not yet.", Dela replied.

"The taserTutor is destroyed, the gymnasium is buried in rubble. What are you
doing?"

"Shut up. You had all of this power and you didn't use it. You're an idiot!"

Ryn ran over to Dela and looked at what she was entering into the console.

"If you detonate all of the robotic animals, people could get hurt!"
Ryn tried to pull Dela away from the console, but he was swarmed with buzzBees.

"Don't hurt Aira." Ryn said as he succumbed to the buzzBee stings.

Turning back to the console, Dela finished detonating all of the remaining
robotic animals except a handful of wakeupWasps which she sent to revive Ryn.
As Ryn was waking up, Dela initiated the self-destruct sequence of the school
reactor, opened the door to the control room, and locked the control console.
An automated voice announced that they should evacuate the building. Dela
grabbed Ryn by the hand and yanked him outside. They ran through a charred
hallway filled with rubble, the remains of exploded robotic animals, and bodies
of dead birds. Ryn suddenly stopped and fell to his knees crying.

"Why are you stopping?"

"They're dead. You killed them."

"I didn't kill anyone. I made sure only to detonate the robots if there were no
people around."

Ryn gingerly picked up the burnt carcass of a dead bird and hugged it to his
chest as he cried.

"You mean the birds?!", Dela screamed. She suddenly felt filled with rage. She
started kicking Ryn as hard as she could. When Ryn fell over, Dela stopped
kicking and tried to pick him up, but he refused to stand up. Leaving Ryn
behind, Dela raced to the Principal's office and kicked down the door.






She thinks that no one would charge in now to try to deactivate the
self-destruct sequence, so Dela grabs the unconscious Ryn and the groggy
Principal and pulls them out of the school while balancing on only one
powerskate. Once outside the Principal purchases a motorcycle with a sidecar at
the microtransit vending machine and then after Dela brings the motorcycle
around the Principal lifts Ryn onto Dela's lap and they try to escape. In the
final moments, Dela reflects on Ben, Ed, Ryn, Aira, Lita, and Keia, starting to
cry when she thought about how they might have been friends if things were
different. She thinks about feeling powerless to stop her abusive father and
substance dependent mother. As she is knocked off the motorcycle from behind
she imagines she is a bird flying off into the horizon.

...

When Dela made it outside with Ryn and the Principal in tow, they saw that the
evacuation team had already cleared the blast zone. Dela guided the Principal
to a microtransit vending machine.

"Unlock it!"

"What are-"

"If you don't, we're both going to die."

The Principal placed his palms on the machine and leaned in for the retinal
scan. Dela made a selection using the accompanying display, and a black
motocycle with a sidecar rolled up a ramp next to them. Dela ran to the
motorcycle.

"Wait, don't leaf me!" The Principal yelled reaching for Dela.

"What do you think the sidecar is for?", Dela answered as she started the
motorcycle.

Dela spun the motorcycle around and pulled up next to the Principal who fell
into the sidecar. Racing down the empty street, Dela tried to remember how much
time was left before she left the school. Dela did not know how far the blast
zone extended, but she knew that until she saw people, they wouldn't be safe.

"How big is blast zone?", she yelled at the Principal.
"To the treesh!", he yelled back.

"What?"

"We haf to make it to the treesh."

Dela did not know where the Principal was pointing, she had never seen trees in
the city. She was not going fast enough. Dela accelerated, but she knew that
they had no chance of making it in time. Dela thought about what had happened
that day. She had pushed back against the system and won. Even if only
succeeded in smashing just a single cog in the machine of oppression, it was
worth it. Reflecting on her life, Dela realized that for the first time in her
life, she had felt truly powerful. She was always powerless to stop her father
from beating her when he got angry. She could not do anything to keep her
mother from self-medicating her worries away. Being in control, even if it was
part of one day, was worth any cost for Dela. Even if she knew that she was
going to die, she would not have changed much about today. She just wished she
could have had a chance to apologize Keia and Lita. Maybe if things were
different, they could've been friends? Dela's eyes filled with tears.

Dela thinks about Ben and Ed too, and the life she could have had working in
the machine workshop, maybe helping Aira and Ryn in the theater.

Dela strokes Ryn's hair and caresses his mangled face.

"It's the wind in my eyes." Dela thought, "No way I'm crying over those
losers."

Dela closed her eyes. It didn't matter now. She was free. She relaxed her body
and focused on her last few breaths. The blow from behind came sooner than Dela
expected. She thought she would hear the explosion first and maybe have a
chance to look back at the blast before it enveloped her. As she flew through
the air with her eyes closed, she stretched out her arms and imagined she was a
giant bird flying over the empty city towards an infinite sea of green on the
horizon.

...

Ben and Ed on one of their family's airships.

"I hope Dela made it out OK.", Ed asked.

"I am sure she did. Dela is extremely cunning. I have never before met someone
who I might consider my intellectual equal.", Ben asked. "No offense, Ed."

"Is Dela still going to be part of our group?", Ed asked.

"As far as I can tell, she did not do anything against the Machine workshop
rules. The city was safely evacuated and reconstruction has already begun. To
be frank, the MIG always felt incomplete when it was just you, me, and Ryn."

"I am glad that Dela is still in our group."

"Me too." Ben said, patting Ed's massive shoulder.

Ben receives a notification that Dela's powergloves were destroyed in the blast.

"Maybe she dropped them along the way?"

Ed is already crying at the thought of Dela dying.

Looking out the windows of the observation deck of their airship, the brothers,
both remembering Dela fondly, watched as the sunset behind the smoldering
remains of the city.


## Chapter 3

The sound of the fire alarm was brutal. Waking up in total darkness, Keia and
Lita were in a state of panic. Aira was at the side of the bed in an instant,
shining a flashlight on the floor until their eyes adjusted to the light.

"Lita, Keia, put on these shoes.", Aira said, handing each of the girls a pair
of ballet flats from a satchel she wore across her shoulder, "Just slip them on
and let's go. Dela and Ryn left while you were sleeping."

"It could be just a drill.", Lita said.

"We will find out when we get outside.", Aira responded.

As they were leaving the theater, a huge explosion rocked the school.

"Ok, it's definitely not a drill.", Lita said.

Outside the theater, there was utter pandemonium. Students were running towards
the exits as robotic animals, large and small, were exploding. The three girls
ran to the main exit. Surprised that she could run at all, Keia marvelled at
how comfortable the ballet flats were to run in.

"How did you know our sizes?", Keia asked Aira.

"Lita was trying on shoes before you went to sleep and I took your shoes off
once to wear asleep. Your shoes were in pretty bad shape. I hope you don't mind."

"Oh, I don't mind at all. These shoes are much better."

When the girls made it outside, Lita and Keia were dismayed to see Pyr and his
posse waiting in front of the entrance to the school. Pyr's head was wrapped
in bandages. A small of blood had permeated the bandages in the spot were the
historianHummingbird had hit him.

"What's wrong? Afraid of a little fire-", Pyr started, but the paused as he
inspected the girls more closely.

"Wait a second. Did you replace one of your girlfriends already?", Pyr said to
Keia, "You just love 'em and leave 'em, dontcha? You go through girls faster
than I do!"

The boys erupted with laughter.

Before the Keia and Lita could think of a plan, Aira walked up to Pyr and
introduced herself.

"Hello, I'm Aira. What's your name?", Aira said, projecting her voice so
everyone hear as if she were on stage.

"Pyr, but you can call me the Pyrinator, and this is my Posse, I call them
Pyr's Posse.", Pyr said, flexing his muscles and gesturing at the boys behind
him.

"Nice to meet you, Pyr! What happened to your head?"

"Oh, this? It's nothing." Pyr was clearly not used to anyone of the opposite
sex taking an interest in him.

"A bird flew into his head.", Lita said.

"What did you say?", Pyr pushed past Aira and stood menacingly in front of
Keia and Lita.

"I said, a bird flew into your head.", Lita said defiantly.

"What are the chances of a bird flying into someone's head?", Aira interrupted.
She really knew how to make her voice carry.

"Pyr must really be an airhead.", Lita said.

"A real chick magnet!", Keia said exploding with laughter.
A few hours of sleep had done them both a lot of good.

Pyr moved closer to Lita and Keia and spoke in a low voice.
"Listen, I know you are one mistake away from going to prison, so you better
start treating me really nicely or I might have a word with my father and-."

At that moment, a bird flew into the previously undamaged side of Pyr's face.

"What are the chances of two different birds flying into the same person's
head?", Aira said as she grabbed Keia and Lita by the hands and led them away
through the circle of stunned boys.

"He got two birds with one head!", Lita screamed as they ran, hoping everyone
could hear her. Laughing hysterically, Keia did not try to come up with any
more bird puns, because she knew she would not be able to top that one.

When the girls arrived at the emergency meeting point, an very sharply dressed
young man waved at them enthusiastically and began to run in their direction.
Aira squealed with glee and began to run towards him.

"Airunia!", the young man yelled.

"Lanselolek!" Aira responded.

They hugged and spun around, laughing like children.

When Keia and Lita walked up to them, Aira put her arm around the young man and
gestured towards the two girls.

"Lans, this is Keia and Lita. Keia and Lita, this is Lans."

Lans stepped forward and bowed with a flourish.

"Very pleased to make your acquaintance. Any friend of my Airunianunia is a
friend of mine! Please, follow me. I have the best seats in the best airship
reserved for only the best of the friends."

"Airship?!", Aira exclaimed. Lans stopped and looked at the girls.

"Haven't you heard?! The entire city is going to explode! We have to be ready
to evacuate as soon as we get the signal."

"We have to go back for Ryn and Dela.", Keia said.

"Oh no, I'm afraid that will be absolutely impossible! Anyone trying to leave
this area will be executed immediately to ensure a safe and organized
evacuation."

"How is executing people going to ensure safety?"

"I don't know, I don't make the rules, but I do know that the snipers on the
roof mean business."

The girls look up at the rooftops and saw gunmen covering all of the possible
exits.

"I'm sure everyone will make it onto an airship just fine. It seems like
they're in no hurry to launch, but we might as well wait inside. Come on, we
can have some refreshments. You all look positively parched and famished!"

As they approached a regal looking airship, Lans suddenly changed course waving
towards a strike team officer with one hand and pulling Aira behind him. The
strike team officer looked very intimidating. His face was hidden behind a
black balaclava and dark sunglasses. He was resting his hands on a massive
rifle that was slung over his shoulder. The exoskeleton armor he was wearing
made him look could wrestle a guardGorilla and win.

Officer Kransal!, Lans exclaimed, "I'd like to introduce you to Aira and her
friends Keia and Lita."

Getting behind Aira, Lans whispered something into her ear, carefully took her
satchel, and gently nudged her forward.

Aira adjusted her hair and approached the officer shyly, but pretty soon they
were standing next to each other as they posed for a picture together. Aira's
face was flushed with emotion as beamed at the pictureParrot that perched in
front of them. She put her hand on Officer Kransal's arm and leaned into him as
he stood motionless. After the picture, she came back to stand next to Keia and
Lita. Lans walked up to Officer Kransal and stood next to him speaking in a
hushed tone. The officer nodded, then Lans stuck out his elbow and two briefly
connected elbows.

As they resumed their trajectory to the airship, Lans was smiling ear to ear.

"It's all taken care of. Thanks to Aira, our airship has official VIP
designation and all of the best local shops are being requisitioned for the
best supplies. We have complete control of the guest list. If anyone gives us
any trouble, we can have them thrown out. And the best part is that Officer
Kransal will be flying with us as our personal security escort."

Aira was blushing deeply and she pulled in Keia and Lita on either side of her.

"Are you crying?", Keia asked.

"Not here. Wait until we get onto the airship.", Aira replied smiling broadly
through the tears.

As soon as they were in the gangway of the airship, Aira pulled Keia and Lita
into a huddle as Lans was on the lookout.

"That officer was a Lunker." Aira said as tears dropped down on the ground in
front of her.

Keia and Lita were waiting to hear more, but what followed was a bit
anticlimactic. "You mustn't tell anyone anything!".

After wiping her face, Aira pulled the two girls up the gangway into the
airship. The interior of the airship was impeccably stylish and as far they
could tell completely empty.

"I'm going to freshen up.", Aira said quickly, "Lans, will you take care of our
guests?"

Lans launched into his role as host with bravado. He first offered his guests a
selection of beverages and did an excellent job hiding his disappointment when
he found out that he guests only wanted regular water to drink. After the girls
drank several bottle of water, Lans lifted a silver cover with a flourish to
reveal a veritable cornucopia of delicious-looking foods. The two girls began
to eat with abandon using their hands to shuttle food from the platter directly
to their mouths. Lans started to explain the unique origins and laud the
quality of each food item, but then he fell silent when he realized no one was
listening to him. Keia could not help but noticed that Lans was growing
increasingly uneasy as they ate, but she could not resist the food. After the girls
cleared almost all of the food on the platter, they looked up at Lans with
gratitude.

"That was the best meal I've had in my life." Lita said and Keia
enthusiastically agreed.

"I couldn't eat another bite!" Lita added."

"Should we have saved some for Aira?", Keia asked, trying to guess why Lans
looked so uncomfortable.

"Oh no, we have plenty of food and there's plenty more being loaded now."

"Lans, did we do something wrong?", Keia asked quietly.

"Heavens no, you two are absolutely perfect. I was just hoping that you might
save a little room for the soup, salad, main course, and dessert, but I am so
glad that you liked the appetizer tray so much-." Lans said as he burst into
tears using the bend in his elbow to cover his face.

"I am really sorry we ate all the appetizers. We'll be hungry again soon I
promise!", Keia said trying to cheer up Lans, but he only cried harder. Keia
sat down next to Lans and put her hand on his shoulder unsure of how to console
him. When Lans lifted his tear-soaked face to look at Keia, she was stunned to
see the deep sorrow in eyes. There was clearly more to the story than the
appetizer tray. Lans gently leaned into Keia for a hug, his body was
occasionally wracked by sobs as he unleashed a waterfall of emotion onto her
shoulder. When he stopped crying, he looked at Keia lovingly.

Aira arrives looking gorgeous. Both Keia and Lita are very impressed. Lans
wipes his eyes and continues entertaining. Aira is anxious for Officer Kransal
to arrive. When he does, she runs up to him and throws her arms around him.
Officer Kransal removes and stows away his armor along with his rifle. Without
the armor, he looks much smaller, but still very intimidating. After they talk
and eat, Kransal tells them they can call him Taz as long as his not in uniform
or on duty. Aira announces that she is going to show Officer Kransal around.
When Keia asks if they can come too, Lans says that he will show Keia and Lita
around later, separately.

Are you a Lunker too?
A Lunker?! I was born to shine under the spotlight, not hide in the shadows!

"Earlier, I thought you and Aira together. I don't think that now, obviously."
"Me with Aira?! Oh no, a leading man needs a leading lady." Lans said.

"Let me introduce you to subject of my affection, but please you mustn't tell
anyone anything."

Lans introduces Lita and Keia to Ursa. They knock on the door to Ursa's cabin,
Ursa opens. Lita and Keia are both extremely impressed with how elegant,
beautiful, and athletic Ursa is.

Zek barges in on them with Figa (Figurina?) in tow. Zek tries his best to charm Keia. Keia
is unsure why he is focusing on her, when she hasn't fixed her appearance since
before the ceremony. The airship begins to go down (it is secretly sabotaged by
Zek, who wants an opportunity tryi ng to look like a hero). He demonstrates his
leadership skills and leverages his relationship with Figa and Ursa to save the
day. He gives commands to Ursa and Figa, both of whom are incredibly strong and
athletic. Ursa is always cheerful. Figa never smiles.

The airship crashes in a lake and sinks to the bottom. Ursa dives into the lake
and recovers supplies for them. Lans annoys her by asking for more and more
supplies. Figa refuses to get in the water. Since it was already dark, they
decided to make camp at the airship crash site. They talk around the camp fire.
Someone notices that Kransal and Aira's eyes glow in the dark. All of the girls
walk along the side of lake to find a spot to bathe. Kransal, Zek, and Lans
stay behind. Figa waits by the side of the lake. "I don't do water." The girls
have fun in the water. Keia is amazed at how great Lita, Aira, and especially
Ursa look. Aira and Ursa are surprised to see how Keia looks underneath all the
grime.

The Chapter ends when everyone falls asleep next to the campfire. Keia curls up
next to Lita.

## Chapter 4

"What is this Lord-Of-The-Rings, deus-ex-machina bullshit?", Dela screamed.

"Are you upset that you did not die?", Ryn asked confused.

"No, but being saved by a giant bird is weird, and I don't like dangling in air
from razor sharp talons. How do I know that this dumb bird won't drop me?" Dela
said feeling powerless. Her gloves and skates were useless in the air.

Dela drops the gloves and the skates because she doesn't want Ben and Ed to track her.

"Why did you save me?"

"I didn't save you. The birds did."

"But you control the birds, right?"

"You mustn't tell anyone anything!"

"Why didn't you leave me behind?"

"Based on my observations of you, I am convinced that you do not wish to do me
any harm and perhaps may even by fond of me."

"What the hell are you taking about?"

"When we were on the motorcycle, were you concerned about my wellbeing?

"Don't flatter yourself."

"You were touching my hair and face very gently."

"You were unconscious. You were probably just dreaming."

"I feel like it is my turn to tease you."

"What?"

"You obviously feel affection towards me but do not want to admit it."

"When we land, I will show you some affection with my foot on your face. I'm
going to tender, love, and care your face until there's nothing left." Dela
screamed swinging at arms and legs at Ryn.

"Please Dela, you're upsetting the birds. I do not believe you anyway. You are
using deception to hide your feelings, because you are afraid of getting hurt.
Do not worry. I am fond of you as well, and I will do anything I can to protect
you and make you happy."

"The only thing that will make me happy is stomping on your face."

"I will be glad to oblige. There is not much left of my face anyway."

"You've never looked better. I'm going to make some more improvements when we
land."

"I am looking forward to it."

"Where are we flying anyway?"

"A Lunker colony."

"What?! No!"

"You do not have much of a choice in the matter."

The eagles brings Dela, Ryn, and the Principal down on top of a hill.

"How come the eagle didn't rip your shirt as much as mine?"

"Unlike you, I am friendly towards birds."

Ryn takes them to the Lunker colony.

Ryn explains the history of the Lunkers. People went underground to escape
laser-equipped orbital satellites that would indiscriminately kill anyone who
was on the surface during past wars.

The Principal goes through withdrawal and starts a redemption arc.

In the Lunker colony, they hear a legend of a series of buried silos.

Should they go somewhere else or find the silo buried there?

They travel by underground train. hyperloop. vacuum tunnel.

Ryn wants to impress her with Lunker technology and culture.
He offers to take her to an archaeology dig.

The door to the ancient structure opens when Dela approaches.

The AI inside greets Dela and explains that it observed Dela in the school and
was very impressed.

Even though Dela replaced all of the footage of her with deep fakes, the AI saved
copies before they were replaced.

The Lunkers lost the ancient war between dextrae and sinistrae.
The sinistrae retreated to the hidden silos.
The AI is based on a system called UNO, while other AIs are based on DOS.
The AI has been sabotaging DOS systems since the war ended for fun.
No one has noticed because DOS systems are innately terrible.

The AI offers Dela a choice to become the figurehead of the next revolution or
continue in her current state.

The drawback is that outside technology would cease to work for her, but
anything inside the silo would work for her. Also, dextrae AIs would try to
kill her so she needed to stay underground until they could destroy the satellites.

She notices that it makes Ryn sick, but does not affect the Principal.

Dela accepts and begins organizing the revolution.

The Principal becomes her administrative assistant. Ryn helps out by spreading
the word to all Lunkers. He cannot help inside the silo because he has to stay
outside the silo because it makes him sick.

The chapter ends with Dela, Naksos, and Ryn sleeping on the train on their way
to the refugee camp.

## Chapter 5

Lans is upset to leave all of the supplies behind,
especially the food. Officer Kransal arranges for a smaller airship to the
refugee camp where all the other students are to meet. A refugee camp school is
repurposed and expanded to hold all of the new students in addition to the
original refugees that already lived in the camp. Lans decides to work in the
kitchen and uses his connections and swagger to get more food and other
supplies for the camp.

Keia is ambushed by Pyr and his posse (who were secretly hired by Zek) in the
cafeteria. Ed goes to help Ben instead of Keia. Ursa and Figa are not around.
Aira is with Kransal. Only Zek is around to save Keia.

Zek takes Keia to the hospital. Zek and Lita decide to stay with Keia all
night.

The chapter ends when Keia drifts off to sleep with Lita stroking her hair.

## Chapter 6

Dela, Ryn, and Naksos arrive at the refugee camp. Pyr is reunited with his
father. Ryn is reunited with Aira and Lans. Dela tells Keia and Lita that she
has changed and is deeply sorry for how she behaved earlier.

Dela arm wrestles Figa, Ursa, and Ed, beating all of them.

The chapter ends with a celebration in the refugee camp honoring the return of
Dela, Ryn, and Naksos.

## Chapter 7

Dela begins to market sinistrae nanotech as tech detox treatments, but secretly
begins selling them as mimic detection kits to the government.
She doesn't let anyone know.

Taz gets addicted to the detox treatments but he stops taking them when Aira
explains that the treatments are hurting her and the baby.

"How can something that I inject into MY body hurt you and the baby?", Taz said
sharply, his eyes narrowing.

Aira stopped for a moment. She was surprised she had to explain, but it was
clear Taz did not want to stop and he thought Aira was making up a reason to
get him to quit.

"Sometimes our bodies are connected..."

Taz's brow furrowed as he thought about what Aira was saying.

"and a part of you stays inside me..."

Taz's face softened.

"really close to the baby."

Taz sat motionless for a while. He let out a sigh.

"I'll stop...", he said, striking a heroic pose, "for you and the baby."

Aira threw her arms around Taz and showered him with kisses. She had picked
well. Taz perhaps was not the brightest glowGuppy in the pond, but he was a
decent man with a good heart, and after all Aira had been through, being Taz's
wife and starting a family with him was more than Aira could have ever dreamed.

The detox treatments have different effects on different people. Figa shuts
down, Ursa starts crying and loses her strength and agility she
doesn't want to see anyone because she thinks she looks ugly and doesn't want to
talk because she thinks that her voice is different, Ed gets confused and weak
and is not sure where to go or what to do. It causes mimics to grow membranes
and turn black in an effort to maximize photosynthesis.

The government starts abducting mimics around the world.
Aira and Lans are taken by the government.

Kransal is indifferent to Aira being taken. He says that she lied to him about
being a Lunker.

Dela, Ryn, and Naksos arrive at the refugee camp. Dela promises everyone that she
has no idea how the government got sinistrae nanotech or figured out how to use
it to detect mimics. As proof that she has nothing against mimics, she offers
to help rescue Aira and Lans. She tells Keia and Lita that the only way
to rescue them is to accept sinistrae nanotech. Zek also agrees to help. They
go in teams.

- Ben, Ed, and Ryn
- Zek, Ursa, and Figa
- Keia, Lita, and Dela

Is this when Ben becomes obsessed with studying Keia's brain? When Keia
demonstrated her ability to simultaneously control dextrae and sinistrae
nanotech?

Aira and Lans are already dead when they find them at the government detention
center.

Ryn is heartbroken when he finds out that Aira was pregnant with Kransal's
child.

Keia comforts Ryn and he imprints on her.

Ryn begins working on a way to adapt mimics to sinistrae nanotech. He goes to
work at Ben and Ed's parents' company. After he solves it, he starts
distributing the inoculation to mimics everywhere. He secretly hatches a plan
to destroy the government and dextrae companies. He sabotages PeoplePrinters
around the world and starts replacing people with dopplegangers who say they
are loyal to the Dust Queen on Mars to make it seem like she is interfering
with the network in the same way she is with the signals reaching Keia. Ryn
goes to the silo to ask Dela, Keia, and Lita for help with distributing the
inoculations to mimics hiding underground.

## Chapter -4

Keia is captured by the Enders who want to transfer her consciousness so they
can study it. Ben and Ed try to convince her to join them willingly, offering
Pyr as a peace offering. Pyr reveals that Zek paid him to act her in the
refugee camp, so he could look like a hero. Ben reveals that Ursa is an ender,
who used to be a man. Ben explains that many Enders think life in the physical
world should end, because it is wasteful, inefficient, and help humanity learn
anything new. Ben and Ed believe in life in the physical world and want Keia to
transcend to prove that physical life is worthwhile. Keia is rescued by Zek,
Ursa, and Figa. She returns to the silo to live with Dela and Lita, because Zek
paid Pyr to attack her so he could be a hero and Ursa did not tell her about
previously being a man even though they went skinny dipping in the lake before
and had other intimate moments.

## Chapter -3

Keia arrives to destroy Echo Corp (or for another reason?), but decides to stay
when she meets the baby. Ryn comes to bring Keia back, but he stays when he
realizes that she will not leave the baby.

## Chapter -2

Lita arrives to retrieve Keia. Keia explains that she cannot leave because the
baby will not let her. Lita has trouble believing it, but she agrees to stay.
Dela, Kransal, and the Principal show up and Dela says that she respects their
decision to leave sinistrae, even though she strongly disagrees. They live
happily for a while despite Keia's visions and the baby's mind control, but
then Lita getting ill. Zek informs them that Lita is sick and dying. Dela tries
to heal Lita with sinistrae tech, but it doesn't work. Zek cannot heal her
either.

Lita says that she wants to stay with Keia rather than go back to the silo to
try to save her life there, because it looks like the disease is incurable. Zek
says that he can turn Lita into an ender and then bring her back. Lita is
scanned and they print her. Lita says feels fine but that being brought back
definitely changed her, even though she cannot describe in what way she is
different. Ursa shows Lita how to use her powers. Ursa explains that Lita needs
to channel the energy away from her or she might lose a hand or even arm. After
Ursa discharges much of her energy in a demo of how to use ender powers, Lita
asks Ursa to show it to her again and then immediately kills her. Ursa's head
explodes spraying blood everywhere. Lita's hand is blown off. "Oopsie," Lita
says, "I guess I didn't channel the energy away from me." looking at the bloody
stump where her used to be. As Zek and Figa spring into battle, Dela, Kransal,
and the Principal defend Lita while Keia watches in horror. Zek blinds Lita,
but his powers are useless against the sinistrae and as Lita tries to get away
falling down on the ground, Zek is about to kill Lita when Dela knocks him out
and rips apart his snakes. No longer blinded Lita kills Zek by exploding his
head. "I'm getting the hang of this!", she said triumphantly looking at the
bloody stump where her foot used to be. Dela, Naksos, and Kransal rip Figa to
pieces, but she remains alive as a disembodied head. Lita says she just wants
them all to be together, but Keia doesn't believe her. Lita says she wants to
kill the baby, so they can all be together. Dela and the Principal subdue Lita.
Keia moves to a forest cabin near the silo the Dela has built for her, so that
Dela can keep her safe. Figa's disembodied head is there too. Figa still says
she wants revenge against Lita and Dela for killing Ursa and Zek. Figa won't
agree to let Dela try to fix her, because she doesn't trust her. Figa gets
energy from the sun to charge his fuel cells. Dela brings groceries and other
supplies, and spends time with Keia and the baby, even though the baby doesn't
like not being able to control Dela or read her mind.

Keia believes that Lita's consciousness has been corrupted, perhaps by the
Dust Queen.

Dela says that the rebuilt Lita destabilized even further and is being kept in
the silo so that she cannot hurt anyone else. Dela asks if Keia wants to see
Lita. Keia replies that the person who killed Ursa and Zek is not Lita. Dela
says that she is working on curing Lita, but has not made any progress. Dela
says that she loves Keia, but she thinks that Keia doesn't love her, but that
Dela is prepared to wait. Keia says that she is hurt and confused, but is very
glad that she is not alone. Dela says that maybe when the baby gets older that they
can all live together as a family. Dela leaves.

## Chapter -1

Ryn shows up and ask Keia to leave with him. He explains how Dela planned
everything and is keeping Lita's consciousness prisoner after rebuilding her in
a diseased body and that the consciousness in Lita's latest body is Dela's.
Keia doesn't know if she can believe him, but he says that Dela will kill him
and hunt down all mimics if she finds out. Keia decides to confront Dela. Dela
denies everything, but then Keia asks to see Lita. Dela takes Keia to see Lita,
but when Lita cannot recall any of the details of their childhood, Keia becomes
convinced that Ryn was telling the truth. Keia says that she doesn't want to
stay with Dela anymore. Dela says Keia is welcome to leave, but that she is
heart broken that Keia doesn't want to stay and that Dela cannot protect her if
she leaves. Keia says that she will stay, but only if Dela admits what she did.
Dela maintains that she did not do the things that Ryn said.

Should Keia believe Dela or Ryn? Both could be lying. Ryn's explanation seems
crazy enough to be true. Dela says that sinistrae don't have the tech that Ryn
says they do and that only enders do, but that the ender tech is compromised.
She says that she is trying to recreate that functionality using sinistrae
technology. Dela says that she has nothing to hide and that she would bring
back Lita if she could.

When her son starts talking, Keia is very happy to have Figa because she can
keep her son busy just by talking to him and she can answer all of his
questions. Her son promises to build Figa a new body so he can give her a hug.
Figa is overwhelmed with emotion.

"I found her, Mommy."

"Who did you find, sweetie?"

"Lita."

Keia studied her son's face. How could he know? He was just a baby.

"I know you love her a lot, Mommy, you dream about her all the time, sometimes
even you are awake." he said, "Don't worry, I am not jealous. I know you
can love me and her at the same time."

Keia started to tear up.

"Don't cry, Mommy. When I get bigger, I am going to bring her back. And Daddy
and my other Mommy... don't be jealous, but I still dream about my other Mommy.
I wish they were all here again. Even though I can talk to them, I still miss
them."

"You can talk to them?"

"Mommy... you don't to talk to them?"

"Mommy doesn't know how...", Keia answered.

Her son sat very still.

"Am I the only one who can?"

"I think you are, honey."

"I guess that makes me very special..."

"You are very special to Mommy."

"Do you want me to show you how to talk to them?"

"Yes, please."

Keia talks to Lita. Lita is surprised to see Keia and asks who is with her.
Keia tells her that it's her son. Lita thinks that Keia went on with her life
instead of trying to save Lita. The experience leaves Keia heartbroken.

"Who's the lucky guy?"

Lita did not know why Keia left. Keia didn't know how to explain.

"Zek is the father, but that I never slept with him."

"Immaculate conception?"

"Zek did some science thing and Ursa became pregnant with our baby."

"It sounds like Ursa is the surrogate mother."

"Ursa is gone, so is Zek."

"What happened to them?"

Keia didn't know how to explain, so she just went with the truth.
"Someone came back in your body and killed them. I think it was Dela."

"How old is he?", Lita asks gesturing towards Keia's son.

"Four?! It's been 4 years?"

Keia was silent.

"Are you even trying to get me out? It looks like you've moved on."

"You have a kid with Zek and with Ursa. I understand that you don't have any
room in your life for me, but do you think you might find some time to get me
out of here?"

"It's not like that! I think about you every day! I thought you died! You did die..."

"Look all of this is hard to believe. During the past four years did you even
try to find me. This is the first time you've even ever visited me..."

"No, I didn't even know...", Keia said, crying.

Lita slowly disolved away.

"No, no, No!", cried Keia, "What happened? Where did Lita go?"

"She was making Mommy cry..."

Keia broke down. Everything Ryn said was true. Lita was trapped in the digital
world of the Enders. Like the other Enders, she couldn't come back to the
physical because of the virus that Dela and Ryn created. Keia knew that she
needed Ben's help, but he was probably not going to want to help her since she
killed him. She asks Ryn to help her get Lita back. Ryn agrees but he says that
he has no idea how to do it. Keia asks her son to let her talk to Zek. Keia
asks Zek how to free them. Zek says that he is working on it from the surface
of Mars, but it might take him many years and it might be up to Keia to rescue
them. He can start to echo into another body but that will take at least a
decade. Zek cautions Keia that restoring the ability of Enders to enter the
physical world could start a war.

Keia gets Lita back, but it takes many years, and when they bring Lita back
everyone thinks that Keia is Lita's mother, because the years have taken a toll
on Keia and Lita has the freshly printed glow and the new car smell.

When he grows up, Keia's son tries to sleep with Lita, Figa, and Ursa.

## Prologue

Keia leaves and Ryn joins her in secret. Keia asks Ryn if he lied. Ryn says
that he did not lie and he can explain everything that happened. Keia believes
him because he knows details that he wouldn't have otherwise been able to know.

Ryn and Keia are living in a cave by the sea (like in Caotica
Ana).

Ben and Ed arrive accusing Ryn of sabotaging the PeoplePrinters. Ryn admits to
it immediately and he says that he already told Keia. Ben says that most Enders
are now convinced that physical life needs to end, but that might still be able
to convince them to not eradicate physical life if Keia transcends. Ben says
that they will not hurt Keia's baby but they will study him. Ben says that they
want revenge on Ryn, because their companies tanked during the shift from
dextrae to sinistrae and that they still want to study Keia's brain and also
want to study the baby. Keia doesn't want to hand Ryn over. Ryn starts to
explain that Dela planned everything and convinced him to help in exchange for
favorable conditions for mimics. He says that she threatened to slaughter
mimics like the government if he didn't help her. Ben and Ed say that all of
that doesn't matter they still want revenge against him.

Keia faces off against Ben and Ed, and kills them both using her dextrae and
sinistrae powers with the help of Ryn. Keia's visions get stronger as the baby
gets stronger and learns to break through sinistrae defenses. Keia weeps as she
realizes that she has no way of getting Lita back and that the baby and the
visions will drive her crazy. She knows she will have to go to Mars to stop the
visions. She wonders if she will ever see Lita again. She thinks she might be
going crazy. She decides to go back to Dela. She starts to think that maybe
Dela is telling the truth and that Ryn is lying. Being near the silo helps
control her visions and she needs larger and larger doses of sinistrae to keep
her baby from ravaging her mind. Ryn is afraid that Dela will kill him, so he
doesn't go with Keia.

When Keia arrives at the silo, Dela is very happy to see Keia and says that
she can forgive Ryn if he admits that he lied to keep Keia all to himself.

Then Dela says that she forgave Ryn and that Ryn is ready to apologize for
lying. Ryn says that he is sorry that he lied and asks if he can still live
with Keia. Keia doesn't know who to believe, but she says it doesn't matter.
Ryn lets his membranes grow out and his skin turn dark. Does Keia eventually
fall for Dela? Does she let Ryn live with her? What happens to the Lita
imposter? Eventually the sinistrae injections are not enough to stop the
visions. Keia needs to go to Mars and asks Dela for help. Dela immediately
agrees and says that they will conquer Mars together.

## Miscellaneous

When she was satisfied, Dela helped the Principal out of his
chair and out the door of his office. The Principal was almost instantly
out-of-breath, but impending death can be a powerful motivator and he kept
moving towards the exit. Every other step that Dela took was followed by a
squishing noise as the vomit in her shoe moved flowed back and forth.

fit in at school. Thinking about her friendship with Lita,
Keia wondered if the only reason that they were friends was because they were
both abnormal.

Lita did not suffer from mental illness like Keia. Instead, Lita had a
neurological condition called epilepsy.

Lita often had absentee seizures that would incapacitate her for short periods
of time and leave her feeling weak and disoriented. The more severe seizures,
during which Lita appeared to be tormented by invisible demons and tossed about
by an unseen hand, were mercifully rare.

None of the other students seemed to be at all concerned with the secondary
school initiation ceremony.

covered their ears. loud audio system in the gymnasium had no chance sound of
the gigaphone, 3 decibels louder , was deafening.

Seeing her best which Lita appeared to be tormented by invisible demons and
tossed about by an unseen hand, were mercifully rare. Keia held Lita's hands,
which unfortunately led to another round of jeers. Seeing her best which Lita
appeared to be tormented by invisible demons and tossed about by an unseen
hand, were mercifully rare. 

### Lans

"Can I tell you something? I want to tell you, but you mustn't tell anyone
anything, please."

Keia emphatically agreed and Lita was quick to echo the sentiment.

"When I was little, I lived in a orphanage made of stone. I was happy, because
I had so many friends, but it was hard. There was no one to take care of us.
Everyone was hungry all of the time, except for me, because-", Lans looked
around the empty airship cabin, "I can photosynthesize."

"After all the buildings were replaced with factories, we stopped seeing any
grown-ups anymore, everything was automated or controlled remotely. The river
slowly turned into sludge and all the vegetation died. My friends and I stopped
being able to find food. I didn't want to see them starve, so I begged them to
eat me first, but they wouldn't, they said they didn't want to hurt me. When it
got really bad, I was the only who could still move. I would cut off pieces",
Lans pointed to his torso, arms, and legs, "and give it to them, but the meat
would grow back so slowly and there were so many friends to feed. When a friend
died, I would redistribute them to the friends who were still alive, but soon
all my friends were gone. When the constructions crews came to clear the
orphanage, they saw me escaping from the rubble. They thought that I ate my
friends to survive. I couldn't tell them the truth. People who are different
get taken. My parents were taken, because they were different. If someone finds
out about me, I will get taken too. That's why you mustn't tell anyone
anything."

When Lans finished his story, Keia looked back at Lita. Neither of them had any
idea what to do.

"Everyone has these incredibly traumatic events in their lives. Are you going
to surprise me with some trauma I never heard about even though we grew up 
together?"

"No, are you?"
"No, before today I really didn't have much going on in the trauma department."
"I think you are projecting the Lunkers who saved you onto Officer Kransal."
"Yes, I think you are right but it still makes me happy, so I think it is ok."
