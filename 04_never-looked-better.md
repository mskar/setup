## Chapter 4

"What is this Lord-Of-The-Rings, deus-ex-machina bullshit?", Fera screamed.

"Are you upset that you did not die?", Ryn asked confused.

"No, but being saved by a giant bird is weird, and I don't like dangling in air
from razor sharp talons. How do I know that this dumb bird won't drop me?" Fera
said feeling powerless. Her gloves and skates were useless in the air.

Fera drops the gloves and the skates because she doesn't want Ben and Ed to track her.

"Why did you save me?"

"I didn't save you. The birds did."

"But you control the birds, right?"

"You mustn't tell anyone anything!"

"Why didn't you leave me behind?"

"Based on my observations of you, I am convinced that you do not wish to do me
any harm and perhaps may even by fond of me."

"What the hell are you taking about?"

"When we were on the motorcycle, were you concerned about my wellbeing?

"Don't flatter yourself."

"You were touching my hair and face very gently."

"You were unconscious. You were probably just dreaming."

"I feel like it is my turn to tease you."

"What?"

"You obviously feel affection towards me but do not want to admit it."

"When we land, I will show you some affection with my foot on your face. I'm
going to tender, love, and care your face until there's nothing left." Fera
screamed swinging at arms and legs at Ryn.

"Please Fera, you're upsetting the birds. I do not believe you anyway. You are
using deception to hide your feelings, because you are afraid of getting hurt.
Do not worry. I am fond of you as well, and I will do anything I can to protect
you and make you happy."

"The only thing that will make me happy is stomping on your face."

"I will be glad to oblige. There is not much left of my face anyway."

"You've never looked better. I'm going to make some more improvements when we
land."

"I am looking forward to it."

"Where are we flying anyway?"

"A Lunker colony."

"What?! No!"

"You do not have much of a choice in the matter."

The eagles brings Fera, Ryn, and the Principal down on top of a hill.

"How come the eagle didn't rip your shirt as much as mine?"

"Unlike you, I am friendly towards birds."

Ryn takes them to the Lunker colony.

Ryn explains the history of the Lunkers. People went underground to escape
laser-equipped orbital satellites that would indiscriminately kill anyone who
was on the surface during past wars.

The Principal goes through withdrawal and starts a redemption arc.

In the Lunker colony, they hear a legend of a series of buried silos.

Should they go somewhere else or find the silo buried there?

They travel by underground train. hyperloop. vacuum tunnel.

Ryn wants to impress her with Lunker technology and culture.
He offers to take her to an archaeology dig.

The door to the ancient structure opens when Fera approaches.

The AI inside greets Fera and explains that it observed Fera in the school and
was very impressed.

Even though Fera replaced all of the footage of her with deep fakes, the AI saved
copies before they were replaced.

The Lunkers lost the ancient war between dextrae and sinistrae.
The sinistrae retreated to the hidden silos.
The AI is based on a system called UNO, while other AIs are based on DOS.
The AI has been sabotaging DOS systems since the war ended for fun.
No one has noticed because DOS systems are innately terrible.

The AI offers Fera a choice to become the figurehead of the next revolution or
continue in her current state.

The drawback is that outside technology would cease to work for her, but
anything inside the silo would work for her. Also, dextrae AIs would try to
kill her so she needed to stay underground until they could destroy the satellites.

She notices that it makes Ryn sick, but does not affect the Principal.

Fera accepts and begins organizing the revolution.

The Principal becomes her administrative assistant. Ryn helps out by spreading
the word to all Lunkers. He cannot help inside the silo because he has to stay
outside the silo because it makes him sick.

The chapter ends with Fera, Naksos (Mel), and Ryn sleeping on the train on their way
to the refugee camp.
