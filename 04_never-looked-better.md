## Chapter 4

"What is this Lord-Of-The-Rings, deus-ex-machina nonsense?", Fera screamed.

"Are you upset that you did not die?", Ryn asked confused.

"No, but being saved by a giant bird is weird, and I don't like dangling in air
from razor sharp talons. How do I know that this dumb bird won't drop me?" Fera
said feeling powerless. Her gloves and skates were useless in the air. Fera
remembered that Ben said that all the equipment from the maker workshop had
trackers. Fera hastily removed her gloves and skates, dropping them into the
city below.

"Why did you save me?"

"I didn't save you. The birds did."

"But you control the birds, right?"

"You mustn't tell anyone anything!"

"Why didn't you leave me behind?"

"Based on my observations of you, I am convinced that you do not wish to do me
any harm and perhaps may even by fond of me."

"What the hell are you taking about?"

"When we were on the motorcycle, were you concerned about my wellbeing?

"Don't flatter yourself."

"You touched my hair very gently."

"You were unconscious. You were probably just dreaming."

"I feel like it is my turn to tease you."

"What?"

"You obviously feel affection towards me but you do not want to admit it."

"When we land, I will show you some affection with my foot on your face. I'm
going to tender, love, and care your face until there's nothing left." Fera
screamed swinging at arms and legs at Ryn.

"Please Fera, you're upsetting the birds. I do not believe you anyway. You are
using deception to hide your feelings, because you are afraid of getting hurt.
Do not worry. I am fond of you as well, and I will do anything I can to protect
you and make you happy."

"The only thing that will make me happy is stomping on your face."

"I will be glad to oblige. There is not much left of my face anyway."

"You've never looked better. I'm going to make some more improvements when we
land."

"I am looking forward to it."

"Where are we flying anyway?"

"A Lunker colony."

"What?! No!"

"You do not have much of a choice in the matter."

The eagles set Fera, Ryn, and the Principal down next to a forest.

"The entrance is hidden in the forest. We have to walk the rest of the way."

"How come the eagle didn't rip your shirt as much as mine?"

"Unlike you, I am friendly towards birds."

Only a few minutes into the forest, Fera and Ryn noticed that the Principal
looked terrible. After a few more minutes, the Principal fell over and began to
shake.

"He's going into withdrawal!", Ryn said.

"What should we do?", Fera asked.

"I'm going to call for help."

"No more birds!", Fera yelled.

"Ok, no more birds.", Ryn agreed.

Ryn closed his eyes. Before long, two stags emerged from the trees.

Fera and Ryn lifted the Principal onto one of the stags. Ryn grabbed onto the
antlers of the stag carrying the Principal and swung himself up onto its back.
Fera did her best to mount the other stag as gracefully as Ryn. The stags
sprinted in between the trees as if they knew exactly where to go. Fera had
never even ridden a horse, much less a stag. She held onto the antlers of her
stag for dear life. The stags stopped in front a giant tree. Ryn hopped of his
stag and raised arms showing his palms.

"We need your help!", Ryn said.

"Ryn, there's no one here."

Ryn kept looking at the giant tree.

"Do you expect the tree to help us? Are you going to show it how you can grow
roots and photosynthesize?"

"You mustn't tell anyone anything!", Ryn said forcefully.

"Look, if this tree is your whole plan, then I think the Principal is as good
as dead."

A door opened up in the side of the giant tree and small elderly woman got out.

"Who are you to request the aid the druidicDryads?"

"I am Ryn. One of my companions is recovering from exposure to narcotics. He
may die without your help."

"How is it that you know this forest?"

"I do not this forest, but these stags do."

"How is it that you can command the stags?"

"I am a mimic."

"A mimic? We have heard of your kind. That means that these stags are mimics
too and not real animals."

"We"

"Are you sure it is not a question of motivation? I am sure a few kicks to the
face would motivate you."

"Wait."

"I am not going to wait."

"Wait, we are surrounded."

"There's no one here, Ryn."

"We are Arborists. We speak for the trees. You are trespassing in our forest."

"I am Fera. We have no interest in your forest, we are trying to find the
entrance to Fundus."

"The Cacumina will look for people to blame for the destruction of their city."

"They're not going to blame you."

"How can you be certain of this?"

"Because I am the one who blew up the city."

"How did a child such as you destroy a whole city?"

"She activated the self-destruct sequence of the school reactor, which caused a
chain reaction and all of the reactors in the city exploded at once."

"Why did you blow up the city?"

"I am tired of government-mandated oppression. I blew up the city as part of
the revolution that will overthrow the government and usher in a new era of
freedom and equality."

The Arborists conferred.

"Your words do not sound hollow. We will allow you pass. Moreover, we will
guide you to the nearest entrance to Fundus. First, we wish to equip the city
destroyer for her quest to overthrow the government."

Fera a bit disappointed that knives and arrows she received were completely
wooden. When she tried the edges of the knives, she was surprised that they
were quite sharp.

"The knives and arrows are lignum vitae wood. They cannot break steel, but they can cut flesh."

The shoes, moccasins made out of animal skin, were a big improvement
over walking in her socks along. The Arborists assumed that Fera knew how to
shoot a bow, but the truth she had no idea.

"Why do your people live in the forest?"

"It is the same reason why Fundis hid below and Atlantans went underneath the
ocean. A long time in a great war, light would come down from the sky to kill
those who walked in the open. Our Ancestors noticed that if we stayed in the
forest that we would not die from the light. Our ancestors thought that the
light was sent from the heavens to show us the correct way to live. Even when
the light stopped taking people who walked in the open, we stayed in the
forest."

Ryn takes them to the Lunker colony.

Ryn explains the history of the Lunkers. People went underground to escape
laser-equipped orbital satellites that would indiscriminately kill anyone who
was on the surface during past wars.

The Principal goes through withdrawal and starts a redemption arc.

In the Lunker colony, a young Lunker approaches them and says that they have
won a free boat ride for three.

"Congratulations, you've won a free, all-expenses-paid trip to Wieliczka salt
mine, including a free boat ride on Lake Wessel, for three people!

"Excuse us, we need to discuss." Fera said, drawing Mel and Ryn into a huddle.

"Don't you think it is suspicious that it's a free tip and boat ride
specifically for three people? There are exactly three of us. It seems a little
on the nose."

"We shouldn't look a gift horse in the mouth.", Mel said.

"That lake is an important part of the cultural heritage of Lunkers. I have
always wanted to see it.", Ryn said.

"It's a trap and I am going to say no and anyone who wants to stop me is going
to get a rock thrown at their head."

"Please Fera, let me talk to him, Lunker to Lunker. If it is a trap, I will
find out."

"Ok, go ahead, you have one minute."

Ryn walked up to Nil with a smile and started to talk with him in a quiet,
friendly voice. The conversation seemed to be going well until a rock hit Nil
in the side of the head with such force that he crumpled to the floor.

Fera pounced on Nil's chest a rock in each hand and started to make a few
improvements to his face.

Ryn and Mel looked on in horror. They wanted to stop Fera, but both felt that
it was better that Fera focused on Nil rather then them.

Once Fera was satisfied with the facial remodeling, leaned in close to Nil's
face and said "Who sent you?", in the lowest voice she could. Nil was
unfortunately very unconscious and unable to answer the question.

"Lunkers are useless. Let's get out of here."

Ryn and Mel quickly followed Fera, afraid that if they did not, they might be
next. Before long, another Lunker approached them, as before.

"Congratulations, you've won a free, all-expenses-paid trip to the Wieliczka
salt mine and a free boat ride on Lake Wessel for any number of people!"

Fera laughed, thinking it was a joke, then realized that the Lunker was
absolutely serious, and picked up a fresh pair of rocks.

"Who sent you?", Fera asked, raising one of the rocks.

"I got a gig job. "

"Your name is Oil?"

"My parents are trying to break the world record for most number of children
produced by a monogamous couple. They thought it would get confusing with so
many children so they created a system. The first letter of the first name of
each subsequent child is next letter of the alphabet."

Fera thought for a little while.

"You have 14 older siblings?"

"Actually, my parents don't keep track of our ages, so I am not sure what the
temporal order might be. All I know is that I am their 15th son and my sister
Nila is their 15th daughter."

"Nila was my mother's name!"

Fera remembered that Kaia's waipo's name (mother's mother's name) was Aila.
Perhaps Lunkers were not that different from Cacumina?

"Do you have an older brother named Nil by any chance?"

"Yes, of course I do! He was very excited this morning, because he got a big
job that he said would pay a lot of money. He said we would never go hungry
again! Then, I got this job, which also has a big payout. And all I have to do
is to take you to the lake and get you on the boat!"

""

"What happened to Nil?"

"He fell on his face. Repeatedly. So clumsy. He really should learn to be more
careful." Fera saw the two bloody rocks she had dropped earlier and hastily
kicked them away.

When Nil regained consciousness, he saw Fera and shrunk back in fear.

"Wakey, Wakey, Nil. After you fell down on your face repeatedly, we went to go
get help and ran into your brother Oil."

"I fell on my face?" Nil asked, surprised.

"Yes.", Fera emphasized, "Repeatedly. You're quite clumsy. You should really
learn to be more careful."

"Nil has never fallen down before..."

"Well, there's a first time for everything. We'll let you take us to your
stupid lake, but if you slow us down, we're going to leave you behind and go
ourselves."

Nil was on his feet in a flash. "No, if you go yourselves, we will not get
paid."

"Well, then you better not slow us down."

...

"Why is this place called Wieliczka?"

"This mine has been called many things over the years. Magnus Sal, from ancient Latin, and Gross Salce, from ancient German.

"Magnus Sal? Meaning great salt?"

"Yes, the translation of Magnus Sal into Ancient Polish, Wielka Sól, is the supposed origin of the name Wieliczka.

"These tunnels were carved by ancient miners."

"What were they mining?"

"Salt."

"What?! They couldn't desalinate sea water?"

"I guess not. The mine was a huge source of wealth. Salt was the main method to
keep food from spoiling."

"They did not have refrigerators? Or synthesizers to make their food?"

"I guess not. My understanding is that they had no electronics at all."

"How did they survive?"


"This is the part of the tunnel where the salt concentration is the highest.
You can taste the salt by licking any of the walls, but this part of the tunnel
is extra salty."

Ryn leaned in towards the wall, sticking out his tongue.

"Ryn, what are you doing?!"

"Tasting the salt." he said sheepishly.

"Do you know how many people have licked these walls before you?"

"No one knows for sure, but millions of people visit the salt mine every year
and the Licking Ring is very popular, because of its purported health benefits."

"This whole tunnel is filled with germs."

"Actually, the only microorganisms that can survive on the walls are halophilic
bacteria. The halophiles are one possible explanation for the health benefits
that many visitors report."

"No one is licking the walls." Fera said definitely. "Let's keep moving."

Nil describes the carvings in the walls and 

difficult to remember " They travel by underground train.
hyperloop. vacuum tunnel.

Ryn wants to impress her with Lunker technology and culture.
He offers to take her to an archaeology dig.

The door to the ancient structure opens when Fera approaches.

The AI inside greets Fera and explains that it observed Fera in the school and
was very impressed.

Even though Fera replaced all of the footage of her with deep fakes, the AI saved
copies before they were replaced.

The Lunkers lost the ancient war between dextrae and sinistrae.
The sinistrae retreated to the hidden silos.
The AI is based on a system called UNO, while other AIs are based on DOS.
The AI has been sabotaging DOS systems since the war ended for fun.
No one has noticed because DOS systems are innately terrible.

The AI offers Fera a choice to become the figurehead of the next revolution or
continue in her current state.

The drawback is that outside technology would cease to work for her, but
anything inside the silo would work for her. Also, dextrae AIs would try to
kill her so she needed to stay underground until they could destroy the satellites.

She notices that it makes Ryn sick, but does not affect the Principal.

Fera accepts and begins organizing the revolution.

The Principal becomes her administrative assistant. Ryn helps out by spreading
the word to all Lunkers. He cannot help inside the silo because he has to stay
outside the silo because it makes him sick.

The chapter ends with Fera, Naksos (Mel), and Ryn sleeping on the train on their way
to the refugee camp.
