## Chapter 7: A touching reunion

Fera begins to market Sinistrae nanotech as tech detox treatments, but secretly
begins selling them as mimic detection kits to the government.
She doesn't let anyone know.

Taz gets addicted to the detox treatments but he stops taking them when Arla
explains that the treatments are hurting her and the baby.

"How can something that I inject into MY body hurt you and the baby?", Taz said
sharply, his eyes narrowing.

Arla stopped for a moment. She was surprised she had to explain, but it was
clear Taz did not want to stop and he thought Arla was making up a reason to
get him to quit.

"Sometimes our bodies are connected..."

Taz's brow furrowed as he thought about what Arla was saying.

"and a part of you stays inside me..."

Taz's face softened.

"really close to the baby."

Taz sat motionless for a while. He let out a sigh.

"I'll stop...", he said, striking a heroic pose, "for you and the baby."

Arla threw her arms around Taz and showered him with kisses. She had picked
well. Taz perhaps was not the brightest glowGuppy in the pond, but he was a
decent man with a good heart, and after all Arla had been through, being Taz's
wife and starting a family with him was more than Arla could have ever dreamed.

The detox treatments have different effects on different people. Iona shuts
down, Ursa starts crying and loses her strength and agility she
doesn't want to see anyone because she thinks she looks ugly and doesn't want to
talk because she thinks that her voice is different, Edl gets confused and weak
and is not sure where to go or what to do. It causes mimics to grow membranes
and turn black in an effort to maximize photosynthesis.

The government starts abducting mimics around the world.
Arla and Lan are taken by the government.

Kransal is indifferent to Arla being taken. He says that she lied to him about
being a Lunker.

Fera, Raf, and Naksos arrive at the refugee camp. Fera promises everyone that she
has no idea how the government got Sinistrae nanotech or figured out how to use
it to detect mimics. As proof that she has nothing against mimics, she offers
to help rescue Arla and Lan. She tells Kaia and Sata that the only way
to rescue them is to accept Sinistrae nanotech. Zek also agrees to help. They
go in teams.

- Ben, Edl, and Raf
- Zek, Ursa, and Iona
- Kaia, Sata, and Fera

Is this when Ben becomes obsessed with studying Kaia's brain? When Kaia
demonstrated her ability to simultaneously control Dextrae and Sinistrae
nanotech?

Arla and Lan are already dead when they find them at the government deyurtion
center.

Raf is heartbroken when he finds out that Arla was pregnant with Kransal's
child.

Kaia comforts Raf and he imprints on her.

Raf begins working on a way to adapt mimics to Sinistrae nanotech. He goes to
work at Ben and Edl's parents' company. After he solves it, he starts
distributing the inoculation to mimics everywhere. He secretly hatches a plan
to destroy the government and Dextrae companies. He sabotages PeoplePrinters
around the world and starts replacing people with dopplegangers who say they
are loyal to the Dust Queen on Mars to make it seem like she is interfering
with the network in the same way she is with the signals reaching Kaia. Raf
goes to the capsule to ask Fera, Kaia, and Sata for help with distributing the
inoculations to mimics hiding underground.
