## Chapter 9: Gender conceal party

Kaia arrives to destroy Echo Corp (because Zek made her think that he is giving
everyone echo dreams), but decides to hold off when she finds out that Ursa is
pregnant. Zek detonates the bomb that Kaia brought to reveal the gender. He
uses rainbow confetti and multi-colored dye. "How is that supposed to tell us
the gender of the baby?" "According to the ancient texts I consulted, each
gender was represented by a color." "Which color represented which gender?" "I
forgot. It always seemed terribly arbitrary to me. Especially since color and
gender both exist on a spectrum. How many nanometers long is the correct wavelength
of light to represent something that cannot be quantitatively measured?", he
asked rhetorically. Kaia's proximity to the baby causes Ursa to go into labor.
The baby communicates with Kaia from the womb. After the baby is born, Kaia
bonds with him and decides to stay. Ryn comes to bring Kaia back, but he stays
when he realizes that she will not leave the baby.
