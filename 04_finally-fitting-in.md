## Chapter 4: Finally fitting in

"Is that a person flying?"

"Flying might not be the right word. I'd say 'falling in slow motion'?"

"What about 'levitating'?"

As Kaia and Sata were trying to agree on the correct term to describe the
person slowly descending down to the ground, someone else fell like a rock
out of the sky and into the water.

"Did you see that?"

"Yeah, I'd call that 'falling in fast motion'."

"Come on, let's go see find the others and find out why people are dropping
from the sky."

When they arrive at the campfire, everyone was standing and looking up at the
sky. Kaia and Sata could see that the slow-falling person had their arms
outstretched with a giant black bird on each arm. Up above, an airship was now
clearly visible. Iona saw Kaia and Sata approach and explained the strange
sight.

"That's Ben. He can control animalAutomatons like those carrierCrows that are
lowering him down to the ground. The one that fell into the water is his
brother Edl."

"Is Edl dead?"

"From the fall into the water? It would take a lot more than that to kill Edl.
One time, a bugBall weighing almost a ton rolled over him. Anyone else would
have been crushed, but Edl got up and pushed the bugBall back towards the
opposing team."

When Ben touched down, the birds released his arms and Ben bowed deeply.
"Greetings! I am Ben and emerging from the water behind me is my brother Edl,
and we are here to rescue you." Edl stood be behind Ben, dripping wet. He
looked ready to defend Ben if needed, but he had a friendly expression on his
chiseled face.

"Took you long enough," Zek complained.

"We received your distress signal and changed course right away, but we
couldn't arrive until your airship had safely crashed in the lake," Ben said quickly.

"Maybe you're the one who made us crash? Did you sabotage our airship?" Zek
conjectured. "You know, even if you killed all of us, the performance group would
still have more members than the maker group."

"That's not funny. The MIG lost it's Vice President and quite possibly it's
Secretary earlier today."

"Did something happen to Ryn?" Aira rushed up to Ben.

"I am afraid that Ryn is still unaccounted for. The last time I saw him, he was
with Fera, the MIG Vice President."

"Fera? The Fera who staged the protest today?" Kaia asked.

"Yes, the very same!"

"Did Fera die in the explosion?" Kaia asked.

"It would appear so. We were tracking Fera's location and the signal
disappeared inside the city during the explosion," Ben answered.

"I saw her in the city as we were taking off. She was on a motorcycle with the
Principal." Kaia said.

"Yes, the Principal was with Fera and Ryn, the last time we saw them."

"We left her there and now she's dead," Kaia said flatly.

"Was Ryn on motorcycle with them?" Aira asked.

"I don't know. It only caught a glimpse of them," Kaia said.

"Why did the pilots not see them?" Iona asked.

Taz stepped forward. "The pilots lied about not seeing the motorcycle."

"They saw Fera and still left her?" Kaia did not take any pleasure in being
vindicated.

"They said that they didn't have a choice. They were under strict orders not to
touch back down after liftoff, no matter what."

"When were you going to tell us that they lied?" Kaia asked furious.

"I found out myself this evening. I was grilling them about why didn't want to
rendezvous here with us and they confessed."

"Kaia, I'm sorry I didn't believe you," Sata said softly. Kaia could tell that
Sata was genuinely sorry, but Kaia still felt angry. Kaia was angry at the
pilots for lying, at Sata for not believing her, and at herself for not being
able to discern hallucinations from reality.

"We are going to hold a memorial ceremony for Fera when we reach the refugee
camp," Ben said solemnly. "Speaking of the camp, do you think we could be on our
way there shortly? It's getting quite late."

"We're all here and accounted for. The pilots said they were going to wait for
a military evac."

"Cowards," Kaia said quietly.

No one said anything.

"The airship cannot land here, so you'll have to be lifted up to airship down the rescue lines," Ben explained.

"You're not going with us?" Zek asked suspiciously.

"I'm going to go up that same way I came down," Ben said gesturing to the birds
flanking him.

"We can't just leave all of this wonderful food and drink!" Lan lamented.

"Some it has burned. Some it is flooded. Any glass containers are probably broken," Iona said.

"We can dive in and check!" Lan implored.

"A team will arrive to investigate the crash. They will collect the cargo as evidence," Taz explained.

"Maybe we can wait here for them to arrive?"

Zek nodded to Zok and Iona touched Zok a gentle push. Zok approached Lan.
"No, I won't go! You can't make me!"

Zok picked up and carried him to the cables dangling from the newly arrived airship on his shoulder.


Cable scene: Kaia sees Zok whispering in Lan's ear. Zek and Zok start to fight
on the way up. Lan starts swinging to defend Zok. Zok gets tangled up in a sexy
bundle with Lan and Edl. Ursa gets jealous and starts to fight with Zek too,
punching him impossibly hard given she has no ground to stand on. Iona attacks
Ursa to defend Zek. The three of them get tangled along with Kaia and Sata.
Kaia starts to smile because everyone is acting so silly. Kaia forgets about
her fear of heights, starts to feel less angry, and stops replaying Fera's
death over and over in her mind.

On the military airship, Lan complains about the quality of the food and drink.

...

Kaia sees the refugee camp from the observation deck soon after takeoff. "If we
were so close, why didn't we just parachute into the camp?" Ben explains that
the lake was the only place to crash land and the forest in between the lake
and camp was filled Driads and the city was patrolled by World Heritage robots.

...
There's a rivalry between the maker interest group (MIG) and the theater
interest group (TIG). The performance group makes fun of the makers for not having
any members. Ben says that they had as many as four members, but now they are
down to three and perhaps even two. Aira is upset to hear that Ryn is still
unaccounted for. Kaia is devastated to find out that Fera was on the ground and
that her signal disappeared as she was trying to leave the city. She feels
angry at Sata and doesn't . Sata looks
very sorry, but doesn't know what to say to Kaia.

Kaia says she is upset that they have to leave so soon.

Ben explains that airship will not land but it can lift everyone up by a cable.
Zek and Zok start horsing around and the cables get tangled and everyone is
packed together in a mess. Ben flies up first and then helps everyone untangle.
Sata and Kaia are happy to be near each other in the bundle. Sata makes jokes.
Zek gets pressed up against Taz and Aira?


Everyone sits together except Taz, who is on duty.

Lan is upset to leave all of the supplies behind,
especially the food. Officer Kransal arranges for a smaller airship to the
refugee camp where all the other students are to meet. A refugee camp school is
repurposed and expanded to hold all of the new students in addition to the
original refugees that already lived in the camp. Lan decides to work in the
kitchen and uses his connections and swagger to get more food and other
supplies for the camp.

Kaia is ambushed by Pyr and his posse (who were secretly hired by Zek) in the
cafeteria. Edl goes to help Ben instead of Kaia. Ursa and Iona are not around.
Aira is with Kransal. Only Zek is around to save Kaia.

Zek takes Kaia to the hospital. Zek and Sata decide to stay with Kaia all
night.

"Just when I thought I was finally fitting in."

The chapter ends when Kaia drifts off to sleep with Sata stroking her hair.
