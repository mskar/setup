## Chapter 4: Finally fitting in

"Is that a person flying?"

"Flying might not be the right word. I'd say 'falling in slow motion'?"

"What about 'levitating'?"

As Kaia and Sata were trying to agree on the correct term to describe the person slowly descending down to the ground, and person fell like a rock out of the sky and into the water.

"Did you see that?"

"Yeah, I'd call that 'falling in fast motion'."

"Come on, let's go see find the others and figure out what's going on."

A new airship nears.

Ben flies down from the airship carried by robotic birds (carrierCrows?). In
the darkness, it appears that he is levitating on his own at first.

Edl jumps into the water.

Ben and Edl join everyone by the campfire.

"We received your distress signal and changed course right away, but we
couldn't arrive until your airship had safely crashed in the lake."

There's a rivalry between the maker interest group (MIG) and the theater
interest group (TIG). The theater group makes fun of the makers for not having
any members. Ben says that they had as many as four members, but now they are
down to three and perhaps even two. Aira is upset to hear that Ryn is still
unaccounted for. Kaia is devastated to find out that Fera was on the ground and
that her signal disappeared as she was trying to leave the city. She feels
angry at Sata and doesn't take any pleasure in being vindicated. Sata looks
very sorry, but doesn't know what to say to Kaia.

Kaia says she is upset that they have to leave so soon.

Ben explains that airship will not land but it can lift everyone up by a cable.
Zek and Zok start horsing around and the cables get tangled and everyone is
packed together in a mess. Ben flies up first and then helps everyone untangle.
Sata and Kaia are happy to be near each other in the bundle. Sata makes jokes.
Zek gets pressed up against Taz and Aira?


"We can't just leave all of this wonderful food and drink!" Lan lamented.
"Some it has burned. Some it is flooded. Any glass containers are probably broken," Iona said.
"We can dive in and check!" Lan implored.
"A team will arrive to investigate the crash. They will collect the cargo as evidence," Taz explained.
"Maybe we can wait here for them to arrive?"
Zek nodded to Zok and Iona touched his shoulder gently. Zok approached Lan.
"No, I won't go! You can't make me!"


Zok picked up and carried him to the newly arrived airship on his shoulder.
On the military airship, Lan complains about the quality of the food and drink.
Everyone sits together except Taz, who is on duty.

Lan is upset to leave all of the supplies behind,
especially the food. Officer Kransal arranges for a smaller airship to the
refugee camp where all the other students are to meet. A refugee camp school is
repurposed and expanded to hold all of the new students in addition to the
original refugees that already lived in the camp. Lan decides to work in the
kitchen and uses his connections and swagger to get more food and other
supplies for the camp.

Kaia is ambushed by Pyr and his posse (who were secretly hired by Zek) in the
cafeteria. Edl goes to help Ben instead of Kaia. Ursa and Iona are not around.
Aira is with Kransal. Only Zek is around to save Kaia.

Zek takes Kaia to the hospital. Zek and Sata decide to stay with Kaia all
night.

"Just when I thought I was finally fitting in."

The chapter ends when Kaia drifts off to sleep with Sata stroking her hair.
